    "Accurate predictions in data science require a large amount of data about the population of interest. However, data scientists are usually only able to access data from _samples_ within a population. In order to draw robust and reproducible conclusions, it's important to understand how information about a sample of data can differ from the population, how to assess the robustness of a sample, and how to evaluate individual data points within the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a sample of data is representative of the poulation, you must be able to determine how many data points are necessary to draw accurate conclusions and develop strategies for collecting robust samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. **Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment.** Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client. \n",

    "### A Few Useful Functions\n",

    "With the data loaded and ready to explore, let's take a moment to review a few key functions that will become useful for this assignment. These functions are part of the `NumPy` package and their documentation can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/numpy/numpy_statistical_functions.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `np.mean` - calculate a mean\n",
    "- `np.std` - calculate a standard deviation\n",
    "- `np.var` - calculate the variance\n",
    "- `np.ptp` - calculate the range (ptp stands for \"point to point\")\n",
    "- `np.sqrt` - calculate the square root\n",
    "- `np.min` - find the minimum value of a collection\n",
    "- `np.max` - find the maximum value of a collection \n",
    "\n",
    "These numpy functions are designed to work with lists, tuples, arrays, and columns in a dataframe, but _not_ with dictionaries. There are also many comparable functions in the `pandas` package, which may generate slightly different results due to different assumptions about the data. We recommend you read the documentation for each package's calculation functions to learn more about those differences. Do\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample approximates a normal distribution as the sample gets larger, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. Simply put, the more data that you collect and analyze: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the more your sample mean will be normally distributed, and\n",
    "- the closer your sampling distribution's mean will reflect the mean of your population of interest.\n",

You'll note that the `mean()` and `std()` functions are wrapped around the `p1` column from polls to calculate these values."

If you take _more_ samples from the population, you will be able to better estimate the true population mean. You can plot the distribution of _each sample's mean_ in a _histogram_ , which will more closely fit a normal curve as you continue to take more sample means. \n",

    "#### Why is this important?\n",
    "As a data scientist, the central limit theorem is an important motivator for the strategies you will use to collect samples of data. You will rarely have the opportunity to interact with data about an entire population. You do; however, have the ability to choose your sampling methodology and assess the quality of your sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the polling example, this is done in two key ways:\n",
    "- **Collecting a wide variety of data points representing the variation in the population.** If a researcher only surveys people near the mall on a Saturday, they will likely not capture the variety of opinion present in the population.\n",
    "- **Ensuring each sample size is sufficiently large**\n",
    "The quality and size of each sample collected is just as important as the number of samples collected. Take a look at the following set of graphs, which simulates the difference between the accuracy of sampling distributions with random samples of n=5 and n=25 taken from the population.\n",
    "\n",

This is a crucial decision that you will face on a regular basis in your data science journey. To determine the minimum sample size, _**n**_ for estimating the population mean, we can use the following formula:\n",

    "## Sampling Strategies\n",
    "The methods you use to collect sample(s) of data impact the quality of your results as significantly as the size of your sample. Sampling methods are broadly categorized as _probability sampling_ and _non-probability sampling_. We'll outline several key methods of sampling here along with key Python functions to explore & assess data in accordance with each technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple random sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple random sampling** involves selecting data points from a population based on pure random chance. This is rarely possible when you are actively collecting data about a large general population (i.e., all American adults), but it may be an effective means of drawing conclusions about big data when you don't have the bandwidth for population-level analyses (i.e., you can draw random samples of data from a credit card company's list of transactions). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can draw a random sample of a data frame using `sample`, specifying the size of the sample and whether you want to sample with or without replacement. Let's select a sample of 8 job postings without replacement."

    "**Stratified random sampling** involves collecting a sample of data in accordance with the proportions present in a group. This is an important strategy to use when surveying groups that represent a smaller proportion of the population (i.e., racial/ethnic minority groups). You are more likely to encounter members of a predominant group by pure random chance, leading to an underrepresentation of smaller proportions of the population.\n",
