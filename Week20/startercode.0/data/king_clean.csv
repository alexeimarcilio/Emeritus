0,Stephen King,2011-11-13,"By ERROL MORRISNOV. 10, 2011 In all of Stephen King’s work there is an admixture of the ordinary and the supernatural — call it the weird quotidian. In his new novel, “11/22/63,” it is a rabbit hole into the past that pops up in Lisbon Falls, a woebegone corner of Maine. On one end is 2011. An unpopular diner has finally been bought out by L. L. Bean. The diner — and the time portal inside it — may last a few more weeks in the footprint of a burned textile mill. On the other end is America under Eisenhower. The mill churns out white smoke. “Vertigo” is showing at the outdoor movie theater — on its first run. The Kennebec Fruit Company isn’t a curio for tourists; it sells oranges. And John Kennedy, the young senator from Massachusetts, is still alive. The rules of the rabbit hole into the past are outlined in the first pages of the novel. Al Templeton, the owner of the diner, explains them to Jake Epping, an English teacher at the local high school. Walk to the back of the pantry. Mind the 60-watt bulb overhead. Expect the smell of sulfur. And keep walking until you feel your foot fall. Suddenly you’re back on Sept. 9, 1958. It’s 11:58 a.m. There are, Al says, only two conditions. One, it’s not a one-way trip. It doesn’t have to be. But when you return, no matter how long you’ve stayed in the past — two days, five years, whatever — only two minutes have gone by in the present. Two, each time you go back to the past, there is a reset. Like a Magic Slate. It’s 11:58 a.m., and everything you did on your previous trip has been erased. With that, King dispenses with many of the mechanics of time-travel — and thank God for it. There is no extended discussion of the “grandfather paradox.” (“What if you killed your grandfather?” “Why on earth would you do that?”) The rules are simple. There is a reason for this: King is after something bigger. “11/22/63” is a meditation on memory, love, loss, free will and necessity. It’s a blunderbuss of a book, rife with answers to questions: Can one man make a difference? Can history be changed, or does it snap back on itself like a rubber band? Does love conquer all? (The big stuff.) Al — the scuttlebutt is that he is serving burgers made of dog, or cat — is dying of lung cancer. Coughing up blood into a pile of maxi-pads. He enlists Jake to do what he couldn’t: stop Lee Harvey Oswald. It’s a fabulous pitch. “Save Kennedy, save his brother. Save Martin Luther King. Stop the race riots. Stop Vietnam, maybe. . . . Get rid of one wretched waif, buddy, and you could save millions of lives.” Jake Epping is a burned-out teacher with a seriously alcoholic ex-wife and nothing better to do than disappear into the past. The guilt trip works. And Epping falls into the past with a new name, George T. Amberson — as if time-travel required a new identity — and a clear mission. Correct the past. Undo some of the evils of the 20th century. Once in 1958, however, Amberson is immediately confronted by a double mystery: the mystery of what really happened then, and the mystery of what might be otherwise. Before George/Jake can alter the course of history, he has to know what actually occurred. Was it Oswald, shooting from the depository? Was it a conspiracy? Another shooter on the grassy knoll? How about George de Mohrenschildt, one persistent minor character in conspiracy thinking? They are the nightmare uncertainties of an event that has been over-examined, and never understood. Jake is a good person. He cannot kill Oswald without first knowing whether he was the responsible party, and a good part of the adventure is the investigation. Once in Dallas, Amberson has years to get to know Oswald, but he can’t just bust down the door. History is fragile; he has to peer around corners. He buys tape recorders and long-distance listening devices, moves into grubby neighborhoods, trails Oswald as he stashes his rifle. What he learns is no surprise. Oswald was unpleasant in ordinary ways. Emotional, violent with his wife, unsure of himself and desperate to change a broken world.  Did he kill Kennedy? It’s easy to see King, the writer and researcher, as a fellow time-traveler, hopelessly curious about what Oswald might say on tape or reveal while strolling around Fort Worth. But the past, the novel repeatedly reminds us, is obdurate. Under interrogation, it guards its darkest secrets. Weeks before the 22nd, Amberson is living below the Oswalds, and he still can’t be sure: “I tried the distance mic, standing on a chair and holding the Tupperware bowl almost against the ceiling. With it I could hear Lee talking and de Mohrenschildt’s occasional replies, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.” In “11/22/63,” we get glimpses of a nimbus of evil that surrounds the world. There are no single crimes. Each act of cruelty or violence is somehow associated — harmonized, King would suggest — with every other act. Inside the past, Amberson learns there are no accidents, no inadvertencies. Just an infernal machine. (Tick, tock.) He says: “Coincidences happen, but I’ve come to believe they are actually quite rare. Something is at work, O.K.? Somewhere in the universe (or behind it), a great machine is ticking and turning its fabulous gears.” There is a darker what-if. What if history is too forceful to redirect? What if jiggering the engine produces no favorable outcome — merely a postponement of the inevitable? If he had lived, Kennedy might not have escalated the war in Vietnam, and might have kept America out of a bloody mire. But we don’t know. What if we were headed there anyway? Then our tampering might only make things worse. It is not historical inevitability, but something close. Yet Amberson’s own story is poetic and moving. It’s complicated by romance: he falls in love with Sadie, the new school librarian in Jodie, Tex., his new hometown. The real events aren’t historical, they’re very small — giving advice to a football player, staging the school play, doing the Lindy Hop with Sadie. We are brought back to the weird quotidian, endlessly surrounded by the detritus of civilization: Kresge’s, Ban-Lon, Aqua Velva, Studebaker. At first I found myself mildly irritated by the endless swirl of products. But I came — honestly — to love it. The past is full: of slogans and fry cooks and beautiful cars. And King has an excellent feel for how all of that transpires within the forward roll of history. In my favorite passage, King writes: “For a moment everything was clear, and when that happens you see that the world is barely there at all. Don’t we all secretly know this? It’s a perfectly balanced mechanism of shouts and echoes pretending to be wheels and cogs, a dreamclock chiming beneath a mystery-glass we call life. . . . A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark.” King has said that he struggled with the idea for this book for more than 30 years. One can see why. In fiction, we can decide who did or did not kill Kennedy. Writer’s choice (and King chooses). But he pays his debts to history in other ways — by showing the machine and, at the same time, the simplest human knots, the love stories behind history: Sadie and George, Jack and Jackie. It all adds up to one of the best time-travel stories since H. G. Wells. King has captured something wonderful. Could it be the bottomlessness of reality? The closer you get to history, the more mysterious it becomes. He has written a deeply romantic and pessimistic book. It’s romantic about the real possibility of love, and pessimistic about everything else. In King’s earlier, more overtly supernatural novels, the quotidian is interrupted by some unspeakable horror. In “11/22/63,” the quotidian contains the horror, something real and familiar. It’s indifferent to human lives, and it is inescapable. It is time. 11/22/63 By Stephen King 849 pp. Scribner. $35 A version of this review appears in print on November 13, 2011, on Page BR12 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: ‘Save Kennedy’.

1,Stephen King,2011-10-31,"By JANET MASLINOCT. 30, 2011 Stephen King’s latest magnum opus, “11/22/63,” finds a way to revisit and even revise the events surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The book’s front cover depicts a newspaper account of Kennedy’s death in Dallas on that date. Its rear cover presents the opposite outcome, with the president and first lady looking happy and unscathed. On the 849 pages between those covers, Mr. King pulls off a sustained high-wire act of storytelling trickery. He makes alternative history work — but how? It’s at least as interesting to examine Mr. King’s narrative tactics as to discover his opinions about conspiracy theories. By the way, he thinks it a near-certainty that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Mr. King predicates “11/22/63” on the idea of time travel. So he needs to concoct a reason why Jake Epping, a nice Maine schoolteacher who is 35 years old in 2011, would want to live through events that occurred long before he was born. Mr. King also needs a way of moving Jake from Maine to Texas and putting him close to the Oswald family. And he needs to make these developments gradual, plausible and even sequential. Even in a book that leapfrogs back and forth across four decades, chronology can’t be suspenseful if it doesn’t make sense. Mr. King’s books have a far stronger real-world component than they used to, even when he deals with premises rooted in science fiction. And he has lately written with more heart and soul, leaving the phantasmagorical grisliness behind. Perhaps it’s the gravity of the Kennedy assassination that makes this new book so well grounded, but in any case “11/22/63” does not lay on the terror tricks. Mr. King’s description of America in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis, fearing imminent nuclear annihilation, is at least as scary as anything he ever made up. Jake is set in motion by an essay that was written by one of his students, a man named Harry Dunning who has studied for his GED. Harry, who is old enough to be Jake’s father, had an assignment to write about a day that changed his life. He wrote about a terrible, violent family dispute that killed his mother and siblings when Harry was a boy in 1958. Now comes the book’s biggest stretch: It just so happens that Al Templeton, who runs the local diner in Lisbon Falls, Me., has a portal to the past in the diner’s storeroom. Al shows Jake the portal, gives Jake a few supplies (like a plastic pocket protector) and sends him into 1958. Jake gets himself to Derry, Me., the site of many previous ghastly episodes in the King universe. (Derry was home to “It.”) Derry is also where Frank Dunning attacked his family with a sledgehammer, and Jake would like to do something about that. This is a sidelong way of introducing Jake’s special abilities. At first it seems like an overlong prelude to the assassination story. But it turns out that people and places in Derry will have odd repercussions later. Mr. King writes of harmonics, echoes and “the butterfly effect,” two ways of saying that tampering with the past is a dangerous business. He gives those ideas a trial run in Derry and treats Derry as a sinister premonition of what Dallas will be like in 1963. Yet Jake, who uses the alias George Amberson for time travel, finds himself deeply drawn to this lost world. Food tastes better. Music is more fun. There’s a lot to like, even if the women of the era are so easily abused by their husbands. The Dunning family dynamics wind up prefiguring what goes on between Lee and Marina Oswald, making it that much easier for Mr. King to fold the Oswalds into the novel later on. By the time they appear — and Mr. King has fine tricks for observing them without too much narrative fakery — they are already a little bit familiar and not at all hard to accept. Jake commits himself to a long stretch in the past as he moves to Texas and awaits the assassination plot. While he is there, in a little town called Jodie, he falls enchantingly in love with the local librarian, Sadie, in ways that make this an unusually romantic novel for its author. Just to keep things interesting, Mr. King makes Sadie smart enough to sense that there’s something odd about her new flame. And he makes Jake so mired in secrets that he does not dare explain himself, not even to the woman he adores.  “11/22/63” finds unexpected humor in the ways Jake’s knowledge of the future betray him. He gets in terrible trouble with Sadie for singing a Rolling Stones song, for example. And he supports himself in part by making sports bets that he is guaranteed to win. But all of these small touches become suspenseful once the Oswalds arrive, Lee prepares to take a shot at Gen. Edwin Walker in April 1963, and Jake must jump over terrible, unexpected hurdles in order to keep up with him. This novel is more personal than political. But Mr. King has done considerable research into Oswald-related figures like the petroleum geologist George de Mohrenschildt, a man well known to conspiracy theorists. And he constructs an alternate reality in which the Kennedy presidency is not interrupted. It is not what his readers are liable to expect. One of Jake’s main motives for intervening in history is to save lives by changing the chain of events that led to the Vietnam war. But Mr. King, who consulted with Richard and Doris Kearns Goodwin about possible plotlines, turns that aspect of the book into one of its most frightening. The pages of “11/22/63” fly by, filled with immediacy, pathos and suspense. It takes great brazenness to go anywhere near this subject matter. But it takes great skill to make this story even remotely credible. Mr. King makes it all look easy, which is surely his book’s fanciest trick. 11/22/63 By Stephen King  Illustrated. 849 pages.

2,Stephen King,2004-01-04,"By ANDREW O'HEHIRJAN. 4, 2004 Wolves of the Calla The Dark Tower V. By Stephen King. Illustrated by Bernie Wrightson. 714 pp. Hampton Falls, N.H.: Donald M. Grant in association with Scribner. $35. FOR the last 33 years, Roland Deschain, Gunslinger of the line of Eld, he of Gilead-that-was, has been trekking across the desolate landscape of Mid-World, a sort of postapocalyptic second cousin to our own world. Roland is on a quest, of course; he is searching for the Dark Tower, a quasi-mythical edifice that holds together all of time and space -- his world and ours and all the others -- and is in danger of imminent collapse. What he carries with him may be even weightier than that: Stephen King's literary ambitions. King began writing his fantasy epic ''The Dark Tower'' in 1970, as an unknown 22-year-old. As he recently explained, he was inspired by Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' (and by Robert Browning's narrative poem ''Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came'') and decided to write ''the longest popular novel of all time.'' King is one of the best selling novelists in history, if not No. 1 of all time, so it's hard to imagine a better candidate for the job. But ''The Dark Tower'' has never found a large readership (by King's standards) and it sometimes seems like the awkward, left-footed stepchild of his work. The five volumes published thus far -- the final two have already been written, and will appear later this year -- suggest that ''The Dark Tower,'' for all its oddities, has more to offer than sheer girth. King's longtime fans, along with new readers curious about his ever-widening influence and the half-grudging respect now accorded him in literary circles, can find here a sort of skeleton key to what one of King's characters might mockingly call his ''oover.'' ''The Dark Tower'' is nothing if not ambitious: it seeks to blend disparate styles of popular narrative, from Arthurian legend to Sergio Leone western to apocalyptic science fiction. More than that, it tries to knit the bulk of King's fiction together into a single universe (or a set of interlocking universes), and on some level even to accommodate all stories, known and unknown, into a master narrative that encompasses the whole of creation. In King's speech at the National Book Awards ceremony last fall, where he was awarded the 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, he castigated intellectuals for disdaining popular culture and suggested that bridges could be built between literary and popular fiction. For better or worse, ''The Dark Tower'' is clearly an attempt to communicate between these realms. It is a sprawling, eventful tale of demons, monsters, narrow escapes and magic portals -- but it is also beginning to display an intriguing metaliterary gamesmanship that suggests Nabokov or Flann O'Brien. The publication history of ''The Dark Tower'' is nearly as tortuous as King's epic itself. The first volume, ''The Gunslinger,'' began appearing in a fantasy magazine in 1978, and was published in hardcover four years later by the small New Hampshire house Donald M. Grant. (One index of the work's strangeness is the fact that it took Plume five more years to publish it in paperback.) The second installment, ''The Drawing of the Three,'' was published in 1987, followed by ''The Waste Lands'' in 1991 and ''Wizard and Glass'' in 1997. All were published by Grant before reaching paperback, and now Viking has reissued each of them in illustrated hardcover editions to coincide with Grant's publication (in association with Scribner, now King's hardcover home) of ''Wolves of the Calla.'' To complicate matters further, King has substantially revised the new edition of ''The Gunslinger.'' If he's never seemed entirely comfortable with this book, it's no wonder. Its spare, almost Hemingway-inflected style is strikingly at odds with most of his writing. We first see Roland pursuing his nemesis, the mysterious Man in Black, across the bleached desert of Mid-World, although we learn very little about Roland's back story or the nature of his quest. We also encounter Jake Chambers, a young boy who is transported into Roland's world from mid-1970's New York (and whom Roland ultimately betrays). In ''The Drawing of the Three'' we meet the other members of Roland's ''ka-tet'' (roughly, those joined by destiny) and, like Jake, they have been sucked out of 20th-century New York. Eddie Dean is a drug addict from 1980's Brooklyn (although it's not exactly the same as ''our'' 1980's Brooklyn), and Odetta Holmes is a disabled, schizophrenic African-American civil rights campaigner from 1964 who eventually becomes Eddie's wife and takes the name Susannah (it's a long story). As their adventures progress, we begin to understand that the relationship between Mid-World and our own world is closer than it at first appears -- and that the relationship between Roland's story and other quest narratives (those by Tolkien, L. Frank Baum, Charles Dickens and King himself, among others) is more than a question of emulation or inspiration. The ruined city of Lud bears a striking resemblance to New York, and a deranged monorail train, a relic of a defunct civilization, takes our heroes to Topeka, even if it's not exactly the Topeka of our world. In fact, it's the plague-ridden Topeka of ''The Stand,'' King's enormous apocalyptic novel -- and Randall Flagg, that book's demonic villain, turns out to be Roland's Man in Black in another guise. Those impatient to get to ''Wolves of the Calla'' may be tempted to skim or even skip the earlier works. But as logorrheic as King can be, and as much as he can get sidetracked with expository digressions, his narrative is tightly interwoven. For all readers, Robin Furth's ''Stephen King's 'The Dark Tower': A Concordance, Volume I'' provides invaluable aid whenever you want to puzzle out all of the references to the sinister North Central Positronics, or find a refresher course on who's good and who's evil in the barony of Mejis.  King's great strength as a horror writer has always been scratching at the surface of everyday American life -- especially everyday American boyhood and manhood -- to find the terror and irrationality that lie just beneath it. There isn't much in his work to suggest that he possesses the breadth or the mythic sensibility for epic fantasy. But the longer you stick with this lumbering, likable epic, the more its everything-but-the-kitchen-sink enthusiasm and its hypnotic blend of suspense and sentimentality begin to work on you. Roland's ka-tet companions are contemporary Americans, more or less, and King keeps finding doorways that bring them back to New York in the late 70's, where a lone rose growing on a vacant lot on Second Avenue may be the linchpin of all existence. Early in ''Wolves of the Calla,'' Roland asks Eddie about 20th-century America and its narrative preferences. ''Do people in your world always want only one story-flavor at a time?'' he inquires. ''Does no one eat stew?'' Eddie, himself now a hardened gunslinger and Roland's second in command, replies that some in his world indeed eat stew. But ''when it comes to entertainment,'' he continues, ''we do tend to stick with one flavor at a time, and don't let any one thing touch another thing on your plate.'' Even a casual reader may hear an echo here of Huckleberry Finn's famous complaint about Widow Douglas's cooking (not the only reference to Twain's novel in ''The Dark Tower''). In what has been widely read as a metaphorical description of the American nation, Huck tells us: ''In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.'' King is a believer in mixing up and swapping around, and throughout ''The Dark Tower'' he seems determined to cram as many flavors into the stew as possible. Roland, Eddie, Jake and Susannah are enlisted to defend the remote village of Calla Bryn Sturgis, where almost all the children are twins. Once a generation, strange soldiers dressed as wolves come sweeping out of the dark lands to the east and abduct one member of every set of twins, only to send them back a few weeks later ''roont'' (in King's sometimes painful ruralese), as physically imposing imbeciles who die young. ''Wolves of the Calla'' is an agreeable and modestly mysterious adventure story, and fans of the series will appreciate Jake's painful coming-of-age (as well as his plucky companion, the talking dog-badger creature named Oy). But there's something Wagnerian about the book, and not entirely in a good way: endless pages of ''palaver,'' as Roland would say, are followed by action scenes that end almost as soon as they begin. King's dialogue is often clunky and his humor leaden; although he's an old hand at these backwoods settings -- and the resemblance between the Calla and rural Maine is not accidental -- a little quaint local color goes a long way. Then there are Bernie Wrightson's color illustrations, done in a broad comic book style, which strive to rob the story of whatever subtlety it might possess. Furthermore, the entire Calla episode (which strongly resembles one of the principal plots of ''Wizard and Glass'') is just a device to move King's larger narrative wheel creakily forward, to get Roland and his ka-tet a little closer to the Dark Tower and the sinister Crimson King who rules it. Why should we spend so much time reading about the Calla's political intrigues when what happens there may not, in some Kingian sense, even be real? By the end of the book, Eddie and Jake have begun to notice that Mid-World (or wherever they are) is increasingly unstable, and has become infected with fragments of cultural debris from their world: patterns of coincidence out of Dickens, Beatles songs, weaponry from ''Star Wars,'' villains from a ''Spider-Man'' comic. By the same token, every time Eddie or Jake returns to New York -- to save that precious rose from the bulldozers -- the city seems increasingly invaded by Mid-World. King has always been a master at making ordinary objects seem ominous, and in the increasingly haunted Manhattan of ''Wolves of the Calla'' every restaurant signboard, missing-pet notice, graffiti scrawl and snippet of music becomes fraught with dire meaning. (King is a devoted rock fan, and the theme song to ''Wolves of the Calla'' seems to be Elton John's ''Someone Saved My Life Tonight,'' which is mentioned several times.) Neither Eddie nor Jake nor Susannah (whose personality disorder is acting up, and who is pregnant -- but not with Eddie's child) is capable of noticing all the cultural and conceptual leakage between Roland's world and theirs; they don't seem aware, for example, that Roland's semi-mystical conception of ''ka'' is borrowed, more or less, from Egyptian mythology. They do, however, start to wonder whether someone named Harry Potter might be a mythic hero from Earth's future. And in the course of defending Calla Bryn Sturgis, they meet a defrocked priest named Callahan whose destiny seems a little too neatly tied to theirs. Callahan once had an unpleasant encounter with a vampire in a Maine village and has been wandering the byways of time and space since then. As alert King fans will notice, he is in fact a renegade character from the novel '' 'Salem's Lot.'' King has sneaked inside jokes into his work for years, and ''The Dark Tower'' has already incorporated elements from ''The Stand,'' ''The Eyes of the Dragon,'' ''Insomnia,'' ''The Regulators'' and ''Hearts in Atlantis,'' among others. But with this latest installment he has raised the stakes. At the end of ''Wolves of the Calla,'' Roland's ka-tet has been broken and one of its members is in dire peril. These characters may also be about to discover that they themselves are fictional, that their level of the Tower (like, perhaps, all the others) is itself a story made of other stories. How will this change their quest? Will it point them toward a man who sits in a room in Maine, in a world very much like our own, writing about them while a medal from the National Book Foundation glows mysteriously on his desk? We can only hope so. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,        and suggestions to archive_feedback@nytimes.com.

HORROR STORIES  NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES  By Stephen King. Viking, $27.50. Pay no heed, Stephen King says in the introduction to ""Nightmares and Dreamscapes,"" to the critics, their voices ""the ill-tempered yappings of men and women who have accepted the literary anorexia of the last 30 years with a puzzling (to me, at least) lack of discussion and dissent."" There's certainly nothing skimpy about this collection of large, leisurely short stories packed with dozens of gaudy, baffled characters reluctant to believe the varied but uniformly outrageous threats that confront them, forever trying to talk or think themselves out of some unpleasant situation until, inevitably, they're trapped. Even the horrors here are oversized: a resilient vampire with a particularly gross sense of humor; an invading army of hungry, meat-eating toads; and, most marvelous, batlike beings who are passing quite successfully as humans and can be seen as they truly, hideously are only by smokers -- and only by those smokers who ration themselves to a few cigarettes a day. Fans of Mr. King's work will find here his usual menu: wild conspiracies; repellent, zestful monsters; scenes speckled and splashed with gore. Critics, that yipping chorus that seems to unsettle Mr. King more than all the ghouls in his stories, are unlikely to be converted by these baggy -- if exuberant -- tales.  RICHARD E.

4,Stephen King,2001-11-04,"By MARY ELIZABETH WILLIAMSNOV. 4, 2001 BLACK HOUSE By Stephen King and Peter Straub. Random House, $28.95. Stephen King and Peter Straub may fill this sequel to their 1984 best seller, ''The Talisman,'' with strange creatures, parallel dimensions and a black house that's the architectural embodiment of evil, but that's just surface dazzle. These novelists have an almost Dickensian knack for writing about ordinary people -- in particular very young ones -- and making them vivid, complicated and frequently heroic. In French Landing, Wis., a serial killer called the Fisherman is doing unspeakable things to local children. But a retired Los Angeles homicide detective named Jack Sawyer, who has done a mighty job of repressing his boyhood trials in an alternate world called the Territories, knows that there's more to these crimes than mere banal human cruelty. Behind them is a force so terrible it could bring down ''a thousand thousand universes,'' and it emanates from a shadowy house on the edge of town. Though the novel, like the house, starts to show some cracks by the end -- and the conclusion is far too tidy -- Jack's saga overflows with dark wit, sly literary references, suspense and heartache. What elevates ''Black House'' beyond ordinary horror novels is the richness of its cast, from a bunch of philosophy-reading bikers to a sleazy journalist to a grieving mother on the brink of madness. There's also Henry Leyden, a blind D.J. whose powers of observation are exceeded only by his gift for creating diverse personas and speaking in their voices. Aside from being one of the book's most memorable figures, his gift resembles that of the authors themselves.   Mary Elizabeth Williams We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

THE STAND The Complete and Uncut Edition. By Stephen King. Illustrated. 1,153 pp. New York: Doubleday. $24.95. What is longer than ''Moby-Dick,'' ''War and Peace'' or ''Ulysses''? If you guessed the Bible or the Manhattan telephone book, you would not be wrong (though there are small-print Bibles that are under a thousand pages). There are, of course, other longer books, but not many are novels and few of those have been able to sustain a hold on the popular imagination. ''The Stand,'' unabridged and 1,153 pages long, may prove the exception. In 1978, Stephen King, the author of ''Carrie'' and ''The Shining,'' published ''The Stand'' and almost immediately added thousands of new readers to his already huge following. At that time, Mr. King's publishers thought the book would be better and certainly more salable if it were cut - in fact, cut by 500 pages, nearly half of its original length. Now the novel has been reissued with the missing 150,000 words reinstated, plus a preface by the author and 12 black-and-white illustrations by Bernie Wrightson. It might seem unfair or irrelevant to dwell on size when assessing a novel, yet in this case it is impossible to do otherwise. One simply cannot ignore the bulk of this volume. Besides, a preoccupation with size and weight, particularly an American preoccupation with size and weight, is, as Mr. King insists, central to ''The Stand.'' As it is linked with images of the land, of the spaciousness and diversity and opportunity of the nation, this is a familiar American theme. Mr. King has not only read his Melville but also his Whitman and Dos Passos. Like his predecessors, Mr. King is aware that there is menace as well as promise in the immensity of the United States. What appears modern (or post-modern) in Mr. King is that both the menace and the promise have been tainted by a cheap tedium, a repetition of bravado and monotony of violence. This is not another book about a still raw, untried, half-hidden America, but a nation exposed over and over to itself, as in an enormous mirror, part trite situation comedy, part science fiction, part cop show. In ''The Stand,'' Mr. King comes across as the people's Thomas Pynchon. His characters are ''toilers in the vinyl vineyards,'' just plain folks who drink Gatorade and V8 but who also may happen to have jobs on top secret Government installations in the barren recesses of Nevada. The general outline of the plot is fairly simple. An accident occurs in an Army lab doing research on biological warfare. A virus breaks through the isolation barrier and rapidly causes the death of nearly everyone working in the plant. There is one survivor, however, who walks past the failed security apparatus, races home to his wife and child, bundles them into the car and speeds toward the Texas border. By the time they reach a gas station in Texas, he is very ill and his wife and daughter have died a horrible death that leaves their bodies bloated, blackened and stinking. Of course, the handful of people at the gas station are also contaminated and they, in turn, pass on the virus to others in a macabre chain of association that is described in loving detail, like a parody of the circulation of money (the perennial bad penny) or a mammoth game of pin the tail on the donkey. From Texas to Maine, Los Angeles to New York, in a gruesome variation on the refrain of ''This Land Is Your Land,'' the superflu spreads, causing its victims at first merely to sniffle and sneeze but soon after to expire in paroxysms of pain and burning fever. (The AIDS epidemic had not been identified when Mr. King originally wrote this book. What in 1978 might have looked like a fantastic exaggeration, in 1990 still appears statistically exaggerated but, sadly, not so fantastic.) Hundreds of pages of text are devoted to vignettes - some poignant, nearly all disgusting - of Americans in all regions and walks of life being stopped in the tracks of their ordinary existence by the dread and incurable disease. Two things make Mr. King's rendering of this phenomenon peculiar, one might almost say original. The first is the sheer number of cases reported and described. At first, you read along expecting things to change, a cure to be found, an escape to be discovered, but after 300 or more pages it becomes clear that variations on one theme - not progress - are the novelist's plan. The second thing that makes these vignettes, and indeed the entire novel, peculiar is that the characters and situations are virtually all reproductions of American cultural icons. ''L.A. Law'' meets ''The Wizard of Oz''; ''On the Road'' meets ''The Grapes of Wrath''; ''Rebel Without a Cause'' meets ''Walden''; Li'l Abner gets lost in the House of Usher; Huck Finn finds Rambo. The New England we see is Norman Rockwell's; the West is John Wayne's. They are often pointed out, lest the reader miss them. ''She looked like a woman from an Irwin Shaw novel'' or ''It's like Bonnie and Clyde'' are common interjections from the narrator and the characters. At the same time, neither comic parody nor a Joycean complexity is at work here. The reproduction of the familiar seems instead a kind of corporate raid, a literary equivalent of a megamonopoly in which the new owner parades brand names to show off the extent and importance of the newly purchased domain. Everything is processed through a gigantic American meat grinder. Just as foreign monuments become a ''Leaning Tower of Pizza'' or ''the Forbidden City Cafe,'' so the names and words of writers from other parts of the world are reproduced, respelled and repronounced. An admiring general turns Yeats into Yeets: ''He said that things fall apart. He said the center doesn't hold. I believe he meant that things get flaky. . . . That's what I believe he meant. Yeets knew that sooner or later things get . . . flaky around the edges even if he didn't know anything else.''  The few healthy characters seem not just to have survived the plague; they have also survived a rough-and-tumble translation from another medium. There is a Woody Allen look- and sound-alike: a New York songwriter with a sassy mother, who nags and pampers her successful and neurotic son during one of his rare visits home. There is a Jane Fonda character from Maine who is gutsy, beautiful, bursting with aerobic energy and slightly pregnant. And there is the hero, a strong, silent Texan, an amalgam of Gary Cooper and Kevin Costner. When the virus eventually peters out, after having done away with what appears to be most of the population, these and a few others gradually converge on the road, with their battered motorcycles, jalopies, slick sports cars and stolen bicycles, or just tramp exhaustedly from empty town to empty town in search of life and some place to start over. Boulder, Colo., turns out to be the point of convergence for these friendly and cinematically familiar survivors and some dozens of others like them. No sooner do they find one another than they begin planning a government. Someone suggests a meeting in which they all ratify the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Another objects that this is unnecessary since ''we're all Americans.'' But, it is quickly explained, government is really an ''idea,'' and the reality of a democracy no longer exists: ''The President is dead, the Pentagon is for rent, nobody is debating anything in the House or the Senate except maybe for the termites and the cockroaches.'' It is all too shockingly and heavy-handedly clear that such statements - literally accurate within the plot of the novel - could (like the deadly virus) serve as metaphors for the dangerous and deplorable state of things in this country. However, rather than analysis or narrative development, there is a prophetic and programmatic explanation: a satanic figure, who has gathered his evil forces in Las Vegas, Nev. (where else?), has been haunting the American dream with fearful nightmares. He must be stopped. A few handpicked heroes, macho males from ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' or ''The Longest Day,'' scramble over dangerous, desolate terrain to get him, but are saved the trouble when he and his minions melt, like the Wicked Witch of the West, in a nuclear accident. In short (well, not so short), this is the book that has everything - adventure, romance, prophecy, allegory, satire, fantasy, realism, apocalypse, etc., etc. Even Roger Rabbit gets mentioned. ''The Stand'' does have some great moments and some great lines. A desperate character trying to save his mother reaches an answering machine: ''This is a recording made at Mercy General Hospital. Right now all of our circuits are busy.'' And there is a wonderful description of ''mankind's final traffic jam.'' But the overall effect is more oppressive than imposing. In many ways, this is a book for the 1990's, when America is beginning to see itself less and less in the tall image of Lincoln or even the robust one of Johnny Appleseed and more and more as a dazed behemoth with padded shoulders. Americans seemed delighted but in an odd way humiliated when Vaclav Havel, a tiny man from a small country, entered the great halls of Congress and delivered an uninflated Jeffersonian address. ''The Stand,'' complete and uncut, is about the padded shoulders and the behemoth and the humiliation. Unfortunately, it also reproduces at length all the empty excesses that it appears to deplore.

FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT By Stephen King. 763 pp. New York: Viking. $22.95. A decade ago, in ''Danse Macabre,'' Stephen King made his literary esthetic clear: ''I try to terrorize the reader. But if . . . I cannot terrify . . . I will try to horrify; and if I find I cannot horrify, I'll go for the gross-out. I'm not proud.'' The figures on his royalty checks suggest this strategy works, and he sticks to it closely in ''Four Past Midnight.'' Unlike Mr. King's adventurous novel ''The Eyes of the Dragon,'' this quartet of short novels risks few departures from earlier form. By now, everyone knows Stephen King's flaws: tone-deaf narration, papier-mache characters, cliches, gratuitous vulgarity, self-indulgent digressions. Each is amply present in these pages ringing with echoes of earlier King. Most tales revisit the old Maine setting. The characters are types rather than individuals. Even the taste for the crude looks familiar - five pages rendered with more detail than we care for to describe a man's getting interrupted in the bathroom by a phone call. Not proud at all, Mr. King rehashes plot devices as well. Like an earlier work, ''The Stand,'' one of these novellas, ''The Langoliers,'' eliminates all humanity but for a few survivors, this time on a plane that has passed through a ''time rip.'' This ploy of minimizing his cast serves Mr. King's purpose; he constantly relies on there being no one around with the common sense his characters invariably lack - until the last moment when, miraculously, they realize exactly how to avert catastrophe. However, we don't read Stephen King for common sense, originality or insight into the adult world. Many who wouldn't want the fact broadcast read this master of suspense to escape their helpless fear of the headlines and to re-experience the more innocent terrors of childhood, to be once again a preschooler whose heart pounds from a nightmare. In this collection, only ''Secret Window, Secret Garden,'' because it is about an adult's psychological disintegration, fails to achieve that effect. ''The Langoliers'' exploits the primal infant's fear of abandonment, even of ceasing to exist. ''The Library Policeman'' reawakens the most haunting dimensions of childhood admonitions. In ''The Sun Dog,'' the terrifying agent is a boy's Polaroid camera. Mr. King's recurring tactic of making the ordinary function in a bizarre way always hooks the child in us. Significantly, this ''simplified'' Polaroid is too complex inside to fix. We had hoped, growing up, for comforting knowledge of how the world works, but the technology opening onto the 21st century has outraced us.  Also abundant here is another source of Mr. King's mass appeal, springing ironically from his cliched diction, what Paul Gray in Time magazine once called ''postliterate prose.'' Admittedly lazy, - he says ''I'm a lazy researcher'' - Mr. King often avoids laboring at description by summoning pre-existing images from cartoons, old movies, television shows and commercials. Here, sinister men wear ''white Andromeda Strain suits.'' People wind up in a ''dreary version of Fantasyland.'' A ruffled adulterer, when caught, looks ''like Alfalfa in the old Little Rascals.'' Men wish for guns ''like the one Dirty Harry wore.'' Slacks are ''the color of Bazooka bubble gum.'' As the poet laureate of pop, Mr. King is read by many who might otherwise never read fiction at all. He creates an immediate and familiar landscape and could form the ideal bridge from the Road Runner to Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov . There is little here Mr. King has not done before, but once again he proves difficult to lay aside. Andy Solomon is the fiction editor of The Tampa Review.

To the Editor: I am a well-educated individual who reads Voltaire, Colette and Flaubert. I also read Stephen King. Joe Queenan, who reviewed Mr. King's ""Needful Things"" (Sept. 29), should get off his pretentious high horse. I am someone ""with a reasonable-sized brain,"" and I can't wait for each of Mr. King's novels to be published so that I can lose myself in one of his fanciful tales. I even have to ration out the chapters every day so that I don't stay up all night and read the book from cover to cover. Certainly, Mr. King's characters are quirky. But I ask you, Mr. Queenan, how many ""normal"" people do you know (excluding yourself, of course)? Voltaire is like caviar; Stephen King is like potato chips. Too much of either one will upset your stomach. PATRICIA A. FLINSCH Garfield, N.J.

Gerald's Game  By Stephen King  332 pages. Viking. $23.50. Are you ready for this? At the start of Stephen King's harrowing new novel of horror, ""Gerald's Game,"" a married couple, Gerald and Jessie Burlingame, are alone in the bedroom of their Maine woods summer cottage on an midweek afternoon in October, playing a little game to revive their flagging sex lives. Jessie is lying on the bed, ""her arms raised and splayed out, making her look a little like Fay Wray chained up and waiting for the great ape in 'King Kong.' "" She has allowed her husband to secure her two wrists to the mahogany bedposts with two sets of handcuffs. They are both stripped down to their underpants and Gerald is approaching his bride. Suddenly, Jessie decides that she's really not enjoying herself. She tells Gerald that she wants to be released. But Gerald is too far into his fantasy and interprets Jessie's protests as part of the game. Jessie objects more vigorously, which only eggs Gerald on. Finally enraged, she gives him a swift kick in the stomach. While trying to regain his breath, he is hit by a killer heart attack. By the time he crashes to the floor, poor Jessie is the only living person for many miles around. And the bed is big and heavy, the keys to the cuffs are on a dresser across the room and the chilly night is coming. Now this situation might seem to have severe dramatic limitations. What is Mr. King going to do for 300 pages with a woman handcuffed to a bed? A sense of claustrophobia begins to threaten the reader. But Mr. King has vastly cruel imaginative resources, as readers of his more than two dozen previous works of fiction know all too well. Jessie's situation will quickly begin to deteriorate further. First, her senses are assailed. The house's back door is banging in the October breeze, as if to emphasize the freedom she now lacks. A momentary break in the power supply has caused the readout on a nearby digital clock maddeningly to flash 12:00 A.M. like a neon bar sign, but a moving stripe of light from the window tells her the hour is growing late. And there's a glass of water just out of reach on the bed's headboard to remind her how thirsty she's getting. Then she feels the first signs of the cramping that she quickly comes to realize is part of the painful torture of death by crucifixion. She's getting sleepy, too. But how can she risk sleeping in such a physically stressful position? Then she hears a dog barking. The dog is a starving stray, as we learn from a tension-breaking but still potent switch in the narrative point of view. The dog is so hungry that he'll eat any form of meat. Back to Jessie's point of view: the rhythm of the banging back door is oddly interrupted. She can hear the click-click of toenails on the floor just outside the bedroom.  On top of everything else, Jessie begins to hear various voices inside her head vying to get her attention. Any reader familiar with pop psychology knows there's only one explanation for this symptom of multiple personality: Jessie has been sexually molested in her childhood. These voices not only serve to remove any remaining sense of claustrophobia in the story; they also soon make it clear that for Jessie to escape her handcuffed state, which turns out to be both physical and psychological, she will have to recall in full detail what her father did to her one summer day long ago in the eerie darkness of a solar eclipse. This is another reason the fading of the light in that room is so terrifying to her. The story of ""Gerald's Game"" is finally the brutal metaphor of a woman trying to fight free of male oppression, the various guises Mr. King evokes effectively with his almost too great facility at building his prose out of the odds and ends of popular culture. (""Suddenly she felt very tired, and a line from an old Paul Simon song occurred to her: 'I don't want no part of this crazy love.' Right on, Paul. You may be short, but you ain't dumb."") But whatever this yarn adds up to, its details build so powerfully that near the climax you become afraid to turn the next page. In fact, there are little illustrations of objects decorating the start of each chapter -- sunlight falling on a floor, a glass of water, a snarling dog -- and there comes a point when you feel nervous even about looking at these pictures. Except for ""Pet Sematary,"" which still impresses this reader as the author's scariest piece of fiction, the most effective of Mr. King's novels are the nonsupernatural ones, where he resists the inclination to allow some civilization-threatening monster like red tide or green slime to carry on for 900 pages. These exceptions are ""Cujo,"" about a rabid dog on the rampage, and ""Misery,"" about a madwoman who kidnaps and terrorizes her favorite writer. Both of these novels are cruelly powerful little distillations of Mr. King's by no means shallow pessimism about human nature. ""Gerald's Game"" is a work of psychological terror too, except for one significant detail, and whether this detail is actually an exception becomes an important part of the story. Oddly enough, it is on balance optimistic about human nature, if not very kind to the male sex. But it should be read by very bright light, with friendly people nearby. And with no hungry dogs around.

9,Stephen King,2002-04-14,"By WALTER KIRNAPRIL 14, 2002 EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL 14 Dark Tales. By Stephen King. 459 pp. New York: Scribner. $28. The mark of a cultural highbrow nowadays is a cheerful readiness to embrace the lowbrow. In these playful, perverse, postmodern times, no one wants to be branded an elitist, especially the elites. There isn't a junior professor of cultural studies who doesn't dream of twitting his stodgy elders by showing that Madonna ranks with Mozart or that ''Star Wars'' is an improvement on Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. Which brings us to the strange case of Stephen King, the lord of pulp horror who, several years ago, was adopted by the editors of The New Yorker. King's short stories now regularly crop up there, set in the same distinguished font as Updike's. The message behind this move is that King the writer -- as opposed to the multimedia phenomenon -- has been unfairly consigned to a pop ghetto and is better, more serious, than the snobs imagine. The publication of King's new book of stories, which includes four that appeared in The New Yorker, one that was first issued on the Internet and several others from genre magazines, invites one to reconsider King -- at length. At over 450 pages, it's the thickest volume of shorts in memory. Most of the stories have afterwords or forewords that resemble DVD director's notes, with the author discussing his methods and inspirations. King has even written an introduction that defends the short story as a form: ''Practicing the (Almost) Lost Art.'' He suggests that the form is endangered and appears to imply that his advocacy may increase its chances of survival. He comes off as well-intentioned, if rather patronizing and overly sensitive to his own chivalry. More troublingly, he divides his tales ''between the literary stories and the all-out screamers.'' This gave me pause. Not only is King implying that literariness is an easily identified quality, but that when he writes, he can lay it on at will. The opening story, ''Autopsy Room Four,'' is one of the screamers, presumably. An unlucky man lies stiff on a steel gurney as a team of flirty, chatty doctors prepares to saw open his skull. The man can't speak or move, only observe. When he finally manages to make a sound, it's drowned out by a blaring Rolling Stones song. King's great innovation as a horror writer was to inject traditional Gothic forms with all-American pop-culture hormones, and that's what he does here, to fine effect. The story is vintage spook-house corn with no pretensions -- a hoary campfire shocker. In an afterword, King reveals that he adapted it from an episode of the Alfred Hitchcock TV show but added a tricky new ending. More power to him. ''The Man in the Black Suit,'' the second story (and another confessed homage -- to no less than Hawthorne's ''Young Goodman Brown''), strikes out for more ambitious territory and promptly loses its way in a dark thicket. It begins with one of King's habitual prologues and ends with an extended reflective bit that reminds us of the importance of what we've just read. King is big on such warm-ups and warm-downs in his tales -- old-fashioned devices for creating atmosphere that most contemporary writers avoid in the interest of tight focus and compression. King may be self-consciously antiquing his wares, or maybe such crescendos and diminuendos are what he means by ''literary.'' The story is about the Devil. Ignoring his worried parents' warnings to stick close to home, a boy goes out fishing in the New England woods and meets the Evil One beside a trout stream. One expects a lot from Satan according to King, but, alas, the demon is pure wax: burning orange eyes, foul breath, clawlike hands and superhuman strength. He's a Halloween character, all costume, and about as unsettling as a plastic jack-o'-lantern. Encountering him after such a buildup -- King notes the shape of every passing cloud -- I wondered if I was missing something; some wonderful iconographic subtlety that only a master of the macabre could think of. As for the Hawthorne angle, I still don't see it. In ''Young Goodman Brown,'' the evil in the forest is the hidden depravity of a whole community, not just a smelly, cackling vaudevillian. The old tale has a moral dimension. King's version has none.  The last thing I expected from Stephen King, who even the snoots allow is a master storyteller, was to be bored. Yet these stories tried my patience. Sentence by sentence, the artistry is there, and it's probably true that King's prose is underrated -- his diction is frequently witty and exact, his phrases neatly turned and apt -- but there's something about the way he fills his pages that can make reading them feel like a forced march. Between the clever setups and the payoffs, which stand up like fence posts in an Iowa cornfield and are sometimes visible from one another, King sticks to his plowing, amassing scenes and incidents at a steady rate of one per furrow, before turning back and doing it again. A lot of stuff happens -- electrocutions, gunfights, assassinations carried out in cyberspace -- but it happens in the same way, at the same speed. In the literary stories, that means slowly; in the screamers, at more of a clip. (The screamers are better.) Some of the stories defy such classification. ''The Death of Jack Hamilton,'' a gangster tale, attempts to fill out a few unaccounted-for days in the real-life story of John Dillinger. It's a capable effort, with lots of wiseguy slang, a kindhearted moll, a chase sequence or two and a scene of grisly amateur surgery conducted without anesthesia. King wrote it, he tells us, because 1930's bank robbers have always intrigued him, and that's how it reads: like the tinkering of a hobbyist. Much bloodier, and even more conventional, is ''In the Deathroom,'' which takes place in some nonspecific Latin torture chamber administered by right-wing villains. King tries to disarm our objections to his stock characters by drawing attention to the clichés up front (one man resembles ''a movie Mexican''), but a cliché pointed out is not a cliché avoided, unfortunately. In his notes, King calls the story ''slightly Kafkaesque'' -- a term that no writer should apply to his own work, even if it happens to be accurate. In this case it's not, which makes things worse. The collection's best-known story, ''Riding the Bullet,'' was published on the Web and in no time became the world's first successful ''e-book,'' landing King on the cover of Time magazine. It's clunky and full of clearly labeled metaphors for humankind's existential loneliness (life is a carnival thrill ride, brief and meaningless), but it has an authentic emotional undertow. A lonely college kid hitchhikes home at night to visit his ailing mother, and on the way he catches a ride with an animate cadaver. You probably heard a version of this old chestnut as a teenager at summer camp, but King's version has a lurid gaudiness and a lingering melancholy pang. Is it literature, though? It's best not to ask that question. The moment you think you know the answer, you don't. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

By Stephen King. 1,138 pages. Viking. $22.95. THE drain. Things down there in the drain. Things down there in the drain that might reach up and get you. The awful necessity of having to go down the drain to face those things. These are the essential fantasy-fears that underlie ''It,'' Stephen King's latest, longest and most complicated novel of terror to date. If drains ever bothered you, then ''It'' is going to suck you right in. If not - well, the story's other compensations may or may not suffice. It all begins in 1958, when a 6-year-old boy named Georgie Denbrough floats a little paper boat down the gutter of a thoroughfare in the city of Derry, Me. When the boat disappears into a storm drain, Georgie peers down disconsolately and spies a merry clown holding the boat in one hand and a bunch of brightly colored balloons in the other. Would Georgie like his boat back and a balloon into the bargain? Sure. Georgie reaches out. Shrill screams attract passers-by. Moments later the Denbrough child is found dead in the gutter, with a gaping wound where his arm was once attached to its socket. Flash forward now to 1985. Stanley Uris, a successful Atlanta accountant, gets an after-dinner phone call from a friend in Derry that prompts him to go upstairs, run a bath, climb into it, and slice his wrists with a razor blade, scrawling on the wall the bloody word ''IT'' as his dying act. But five other former Derry residents reluctantly accept telephoned reminders of a promise they once made as children. They immediately set out for their hometown. What can be so terrifyingly compelling? It seems that whatever got little Georgie Denbrough back in 1958 is acting up again - indeed that it has been acting up every 27 years or so since anybody can remember, and that whatever the gang of seven did in 1958 to stop it will have to be done again, as the gang once vowed in a ritual of blood. So home go the six to Derry, and forward goes Mr. King's narrative, jumping back and forth between 1958 and 1985 until we can hardly distinguish the horror of then from the horror of now. Mr. King's huge novel is about a multitude of things. ''It'' involves the guilts and innocences of childhood and the difficulty for adults of recapturing them. ''It'' questions the difference between necessity and free will. ''It'' also concerns the evil that has haunted America from time to time in the forms of crime, racial and religious bigotry, economic hardship, labor strife and industrial pollution.  ''It'' is a museum filled with the popular culture of the 1950's: brand names, rock 'n' roll songs and stars, the jokes and routines of childhood in that era. ''It'' explores fairy tales, language and literature: One of the six who go back is Georgie Denbrough's older brother, Bill, who has surmounted his family's tragedy -or maybe harnessed it - to become a successful writer of horror fiction. ''It'' is not only the unknown monstrosity hiding beneath the city of Derry; ''It'' is also excrement, the dark, the unconscious, the sex act, and everything else that is frightening or inconceivable to children. The novel is filled with every sort of scary set piece that Mr. King is so adept at contriving: nightmarish chases; trips into cellars where monstrous creatures may be lurking; a photograph album that bleeds; a bathtub drain that cackles hideously and ''gouts'' blood. (I don't know offhand if it was Mr. King who first revived and revised the verb form of ''gout'' - whose obsolete meaning, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was ''to drop'' or ''to gutter'' - but blood in these pages gouts everywhere like water gushing from a fire hose.) Such set pieces help to hold our interest in this epic of coprophilia. So do Mr. King's raw powers as a yarn spinner of horrors - his sense of pace and scene, his almost adolescent affinity for the gross and vulgar. But he has set himself two formidable plot challenges: one is to produce something terrifying enough to justify Stanley Uris's decision to commit suicide rather than face whatever is lurking in the sewers of Derry; the other is to explain what moved the children to pledge their lives to the city on that fateful day of the blood oath. In neither of these challenges does Mr. King quite succeed. Nothing ever explains why Uris cuts his wrists or why the gang has to reunite. The story moves along, but for all its awesome stage effects, it huffs and puffs and creaks and clanks. It lacks the political vision of ''The Dead Zone.'' It misses the logic of ''Firestarter'' and ''Cujo.'' It wants the brooding, ominous mood of ''The Shining.'' It has nothing like the funereal oppressiveness of ''Pet Sematary.'' It tries too hard; it reaches for too much; it's too damn complicated. Or maybe you simply have to have a thing about drains for ''It'' to terrify you the way it was obviously meant to.

11,Stephen King,2010-11-28,"By TERRENCE RAFFERTYNOV. 26, 2010 “From the start — even before a young man I can now hardly comprehend started writing ‘The Long Walk’ in his college dormitory room — I felt that the best fiction was both propulsive and assaultive,” Stephen King writes in a chatty afterword to “Full Dark, No Stars,” his new collection of longish stories. “It gets in your face.” As if we didn’t know. “Full Dark, No Stars” contains, as King’s earlier “Different Seasons” and “Four Past Midnight” did, a quartet of previously unpublished tales that more than satisfy their prolific author’s stated criteria for good fiction. Propulsive? Check. Assaultive? Don’t ask. The stories in “Full Dark, No Stars,” whose lengths range from 30-some pages to well over 100, are for the most part only lightly supernatural and deal, instead, with the unlovelier aspects of merely human behavior. Serial rape and murder figure prominently in two of these stories; in another, a man kills his wife and forces his teenage son to help him; and in the only fully fantastic tale here, a man purchases — from the Devil, of course — health and happiness at the too-affordable price of the ruin of his best friend’s family. It’s grim stuff, but that’s what readers expect of Stephen King. After all, he’s been in our faces for 40 years. What’s amazing, and maybe a little unsettling, about King is the consistency of his purpose and his manner over that long stretch of time. He’s essentially the same grab-you-by-the-lapels literary showman he was in the pulpy, punchy horror stories he used to peddle to men’s magazines and, a bit later, in his early novels “Carrie” and “ Salem’s Lot.” Unlike most writers, he seems never to have become bored with his own peculiar gifts — to have tired of the wonderful toys left under the tree for him when he was a kid. He might, as he claims, have a tough time imagining himself as an 18-year-old composing his first novel, but it’s no problem for us, his readers, because King at 63 still writes with the verve and glee and heedless ease of a very young man. He has not mellowed perceptibly. He has not put aside childish things. When you’re reading the grisly tales in “Full Dark, No Stars,” carried along by his rollicking, vivid prose, you think (if you’re thinking at all): “God help him, this man is having fun.” A writer who takes such unabashed joy in the act of storytelling is a rarity. This naked pleasure is King’s secret ingredient: it makes his work — good or bad — weirdly irresistible, even addictive. And it disarms criticism, as boyish enthusiasm often does. You might feel, as I do, that “Fair Extension,” the deal-with-the-Devil story in “Full Dark, No Stars,” is too glib and casual to bear the moral weight it aspires to, but it seems almost rude to say so. You might also think (as I do) that the long suspense story “Big Driver,” about a woman who suffers and then violently avenges a roadside rape, is a bit too easy for King: there were a couple of similar escape-and-revenge yarns in his 2008 collection “Just After Sunset.” You could think that. But you wouldn’t really feel good about it. King’s compulsion to entertain — both himself and the enormous public whom he now, kind of archly, addresses as “Constant Reader” — is, however helpless, a form of generosity, a gift horse not to be looked in the mouth. (His readers should know by now that it’s unwise to look into anything dark and moist. Especially if there are teeth.) The sheer volume of his output protects him some, too. In the vast ocean of King fiction, the weaker stuff just sinks from memory without a trace, and without much damage to the reader’s confidence in him: a sturdier vessel is always heaving into view on the horizon. And that’s the case with “Full Dark, No Stars,” which starts with a good story called “1922,” loses its way for a while — in “Big Driver” and “Fair Extension” — and then winds up with another pretty strong one, “A Good Marriage.” The two better stories even have a sort of common theme: in both, people feel themselves, at moments of crisis, somehow doubled, split in two. Darcy Anderson, the heroine of “A Good Marriage,” sometimes senses the presence of another self behind the mirror: a “Darker Girl” when she was young, and later a “Darker Wife,” living what she calls “the Darker Life, where every truth was written backward.” Whatever the reasons for her youthful mirror fantasies, she discovers ample justification for gloomy imaginings in the 28th year of her marriage, when she happens upon clues to the secret life of her husband, Bob, a dark stranger indeed. In Bob’s shadow existence, away from her, he commits terrible crimes which he attributes to the presence of another person inside himself: the malign spirit of a dead childhood friend. (It’s an extremely crowded marriage.) King works the double motifs deftly and guides the narrative to a satisfyingly cathartic climax — after which he supplies a nifty denouement in the form of a dialogue between poor shattered Darcy and a sly old retired cop. “A Good Marriage” is a characteristic King performance, speedy and craftsmanlike and solidly unnerving. (It’s characteristic, too, in the slight gender bias King has always, gallantly, displayed: in his work, men do violence because they’re bad, and women do violence only in self-defense or retaliation.) “1922” is less typical, because it’s set in a fairly distant past rather than in King’s usual here and now, and in the rural Midwest rather than in his native New England, where the other stories in “Full Dark, No Stars” take place. It’s also the only story here told in the first person. The change of air (and voice) suits him: “1922” has a mournful gravity that the other tales mostly lack, in part perhaps because its diction is free of the bursts of baby-talk slang that have become a nasty habit of his in recent years. (Elsewhere in the book, you’re brought up short by painful coinages like “Easy-as-can-beezy” and “nuzzle-bunny.”) The narrator of “1922,” a Nebraska farmer named Wilfred James, murders his wife because she wants to sell off part of the family farm and move to the city. Wilfred tries to tell himself, as the serial killer of “A Good Marriage” does, that someone else is the author of this awful act: “I believe,” he writes, a few years after the event, “that there is another man inside of every man, a stranger, a Conniving Man,” and that it was this evil double who did the deed. He can’t quite persuade himself, though: the stark memory of the crime is all his, and the dire consequences are visited not on the imaginary other, but on him — and on his son, whom he has made his accomplice. King’s rambunctious fiction doesn’t often attempt a tragic tone, but “1922” does, and nearly achieves it. Although he has toyed with the idea of doubles and split personalities before (notably in “The Shining” and “The Dark Half”), there’s a particularly intimate sense of horror in “1922” because the sad story is told in the voice of one of the afflicted. Not much, I’d guess, truly scares Stephen King, but in this tale his prose feels haunted, as if he had, for once, spooked himself. For a hard-charging writer like King, the thought of another self inside the self is as disquieting a night-terror as can be imagined. He has been himself — confidently, propulsively, assaultively — for so long. It’s too late to come face to face with the stranger inside.

12,Stephen King,1998-09-27,"By DANIEL MENDELSOHNSEPT. 27, 1998 BAG OF BONES By Stephen King. 529 pp. New York: Scribner. $28. Stephen King is so widely acknowledged as America's master of paranormal terrors that you can forget his real genius is for the everyday. King's vast oeuvre (over 40 books to date) includes all the garden-variety spooks -- ghosts, vampires, peskily anthropophagous zombies -- as well as a few more unconventional manifestations of the Other Side that he clearly dreamed up by himself. (The next time you start kvetching about your transmission, read ''Christine'' and be grateful your car isn't trying to julienne you.) But King's appeal has always had a lot to do with his trademarked technique of grounding even the most otherwordly plot lines in the familiar, brand-named reality of everyday experience. Unlike the ambisexual Gothic exquisites who languidly inhabit the fictions of Anne Rice, King's characters eat Ring Dings, use Powerbooks and dash off to the Rite-Aid for nasal spray. With his latest novel, ''Bag of Bones,'' King offers his huge audience a tale of something that is bound to strike some, if not all, readers (publishing insiders in particular, and at least one book critic) as both unpleasantly familiar and the ultimate in terror: writer's block. The new novel isn't the first of King's books to explore the tortured relationship between writers and their often recalcitrant muses. ''Misery'' was about a popular author who falls into the knife-wielding hands of a deranged fan who forces him, at the cost of the occasional toe or two, to bring back a long-running character he wants to kill off. ''The Shining'' told the story of a novelist who goes looking for quiet inspiration in an off-season resort hotel and finds a literal pandemonium instead; he ends up producing a manuscript whose simplistic diction would make Gertrude Stein green with envy. Writers, King seemed to be saying, have a hell of a time of it whether or not their narrative urge bears fruit. Given King's phenomenal success, it was hard to take that message as a genuine authorial cri de coeur. But his recent professional anxieties suggest that the frustrations of the writer protagonists in those novels were closer to the autobiographical bone than you might have imagined. Last fall, when King left his longtime publisher, Viking -- which reportedly balked at the $17 million asking price for ''Bag of Bones'' -- publishing gossip held that he felt frustrated at being pigeonholed as a horror writer, and wanted to be taken seriously as a ''real'' novelist. If that was true, you can see why he was frustrated: in recent books like the excellent, psychologically textured ''Gerald's Game,'' King has shown an interest in -- and a genuine talent for -- exploring psychosexual, as opposed to purely supernatural, terrors. In ''Bag of Bones,'' his first book for Scribner, King the master of horror seems to be at war with King the novelist of ordinary people and their lives. On one level, the book is a standard, ''Rebecca''-like suspense story, complete with brooding waterfront house, long-festering secrets (and bodies) and inexplicable manifestations of otherworldly forces, not least of which are spirits who communicate by arranging those magnetic letters you see on people's refrigerators -- a classic King touch. On another level, however, starting with the title (an allusion to Thomas Hardy's comment that even the most brilliantly drawn fictional character is nothing more than a bag of bones), the new book is a novel about the humdrum business of writing, full of knowing and often hilarious references not only to things like crash-publication schedules but to literary works about haunted widowers (''Rebecca'') and unhappy ''writers'' (''Bartleby the Scrivener'') and, most of all, to King's fellow denizens of the best-seller lists: Grisham, Clancy, even Jean Auel and her ''sex-among-the-cave-people epics.'' (Interestingly, there's no mention of Rice.) The hero of the new novel is a King-like author named Mike Noonan, a Maine-based, fortyish writer who grinds out a best-selling thriller every year, largely (it would seem) to suit the demands of ''the wallahs in New York'': his greedy publisher, his clueless editor, his advance-obsessed agent, Harold Oblowski. Noonan obliges, until he finds himself completely blocked after the sudden death of his beloved wife, Johanna. After Jo's death, every time Mike opens his Word 6.0 program he finds himself ''gagging and clawing'' and falling over backward -- symptoms more worrisome, and less productive, than the manic bathroom cleaning certain writers I know resort to when inspiration dries up. When Mike abandons his house in town for an extended stay at his beloved vacation retreat, a lodge called Sara Laughs (named after a famous turn-of-the-century African-American folk singer who once lived nearby, and who turns out to be the linchpin of the house's ghoulish secret), he discovers ghosts galore -- some minted during the course of his stay. He also finds the possibility of love again with the beautiful (if unpersuasively characterized) 20-year-old Mattie Devore and her enchanting daughter, Ki -- the latter being a double, we are meant to feel, of the unborn girl Jo was carrying when she died, whom the couple had intended to call Kia. Mattie is engaged in a bitter custody battle with her evil father-in-law, a computer mogul named Max Devore; enchanted with mother and daughter alike, Mike returns to the world of the living -- and to the world of publishing. Suddenly, he's able to write thrillers again.  So this is a book about reanimation: the ghosts', of course, but also Mike's, his desire to re-embrace love and work after a long bereavement that King depicts with an eye for the kind of small but moving details that don't typically distinguish blockbuster horror novels. (The reality of Jo's death hits Mike only when he realizes, on finding Jo's copy of ''The Moon and Sixpence,'' that she'd never get past page 103, where she'd placed a bookmark.) Inevitably, the everyday and the supernatural levels turn out to be connected: Devore's rapacious desire to gain custody of his granddaughter, the strange sounds of crying children that Mike hears in the night, the letters on the fridge and those that compose Mike's new novel-in-progress -- all point, in the end, to the solution of a terrible crime of racial violence, which Sara Laughs once witnessed and is literally haunted by. But too often the connection between the novel's two main preoccupations -- the everyday and the supernatural, the writing and the haunting -- feels artificial, more conceptual than organic. It feels as if King were so intent on creating a novel with ''serious'' themes -- creativity, bereavement, the evils of racism -- that he got bored with the spooky stuff for which he's justly renowned. It's not that there aren't genuinely creepy moments here: King never forgets that what truly disturbs us is the possibility that reality is ''thin as lake ice after a thaw'' -- that the uncanny lurks just beneath the everyday. (Sometimes literally: there's a particularly creepy scene in which a half-asleep Mike makes the mistake of looking under his bed.) But there's too much in the supernatural sections that feels like an afterthought, too many questions about the mechanics of this haunting that go unanswered. Why, for instance, does the destruction of a real bag of bones at the novel's climax suffice to put a very persistent evil spirit to rest? Who are the ''Outsiders'' who, introduced 35 pages before the end of this 530-page tome, are meant somehow to account for the metamorphosis of the phantom of a murder victim into a horrifyingly spiteful child killer rather than a justly avenging spirit? King never tells us. And when you get to the book's final revelation, intended to explain why Mike's unborn child was targeted by the forces of evil, you have to conclude either that this book's ghost is a genealogy nut with an obsessive-compulsive disorder or that King is stretching in order to forge a connection between the novel about the bereaved writer and the one about the bereaved ghost. Happily, ''Bag of Bones'' is, for extended stretches, as good a read as many of the old, ''straight'' horror novels, but in the end it can't decide whether it wants to be a serious work of literary fiction or a horror blockbuster. The result is a book that doesn't quite work as either; it feels as though the moving story of all-too-common human problems is abandoned midstream for a tale of the supernatural that isn't in the end all that scary. Or at least the ghouls aren't. That, come to think of it, could be the book's final joke at the expense of the publishing business. What else are we to make of a supernatural saga in which the ghosts are less terrifying than the agents? We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

13,Stephen King,2002-03-18,"By JANET MASLINMARCH 18, 2002 EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL 14 Dark Tales By Stephen King 459 pages. Scribner. $28. (Jimmy Malecki/Scribner) The 14 short stories in Stephen King's latest collection are accompanied by a 15th, unwritten tale. It concerns a famous writer of scary fiction who decides to clean out his closets and assemble a cross section of his work. Some of that work has been highly visible, appearing in The New Yorker and thus appreciated for literary merit as well as scare value. Other pieces, presumably the genre stuff, come from publications like Fantasy and Science Fiction and 999, flying below the radar of the author's mass readership. Some of the stories have even been squirreled away in the literary Siberia of e-book and audio book format. And it turns out, in the kind of turnabout to which Mr. King is partial, that things are not what they seem. The sleepers turn out to be the most appealing pieces in this unpredictable collection, notwithstanding their lack of literary pedigree. And the four New Yorker selections are correspondingly lukewarm. Adapting his style to that magazine's rarefied taste in fiction, Mr. King lets his tales become more self-consciously meaningful and writerly. In ''All That You Love Will Be Carried Away,'' he explains in an author's note, he was even persuaded by an editor to trade in his originally emphatic ending for a more ambiguous one. But the reader in search of ambiguity can find plenty of it elsewhere. And it's no substitute for the swift kick of Mr. King's campfire storytelling at is best. ''Everything's Eventual'' is thus full of surprises, since much of its material has been heretofore obscure. Consider ''Riding the Bullet,'' the pioneering e-book that brought its author new and unexpected notoriety. (''Dear God, I was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal,'' he recalls. ''I had inadvertently become a mogul.'') For all the fuss he set off with this story, Mr. King wonders how widely it was actually read. So here it is, on paper: the story of a young man hitchhiking home to see his dying mother. One of his drivers turns out to be a ghostly figure who offers the narrator a choice: will he save his mother's life or his own? During ''Riding the Bullet,'' this passenger has the chance not only to contemplate the void but also to sort out a love-hate relationship with his mother. This makes it the bare-bones version of a loftier piece here: ''The Man in the Black Suit,'' Mr. King's homage to the Nathaniel Hawthorne story ''Young Goodman Brown.'' A New Yorker selection and the winner of first prize in the O. Henry Best Short Story competition for 1996, it describes an encounter with the Devil, à la King: ''And I knew right away that he was not a human being, because his eyes were the orangey-red of flames in a wood stove.'' The Devil taunts the narrator with the thought that his mother has died, a nightmare that the narrator still remembers 81 years later, as the piece ends on a carefully unresolved note. ''Riding the Bullet'' is a less complex and ambitious story, but it is the more streamlined of the two. It allows Mr. King to set up a horrific situation and make the most of it without undue fanfare. An even better illustration of that tactic comes with ''The Road Virus Heads North,'' the single spookiest and wittiest piece here. The main character is an author of ''numbingly successful novels'' who buys a mysterious picture at a yard sale.  ''Who'd want an ugly old thing like that?'' asks the woman who sells it. ''I'd think about it every time I turn the lights out.'' ''What's wrong with that?'' the writer of scary stories inquires. Here's what's wrong with it: the picture begins changing (a standard horror gambit, Mr. King assures his readers). And the figure it depicts, a pointy-toothed guy driving a Trans Am, can be seen following the writer home. Without spoiling the denouement, let's say that Mr. King delivers a final sentence that is apt, frightening and funny all at once. And there is no uncertainty about how the story ends. The title story is another standout, in which a not-too-bright lad named Dinky is given all the perks he can dream of -- $10 a day, plus new Jockey shorts every couple of weeks -- by a mysterious group eager to use his special talents, in what may be the first story to get away with e-murder. Mr. King seems to have come up with this just by contemplating e-mail and letting his imagination run away with him in this story, much as he uses a fashionable restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side as a departure point in another. ''Lunch at the Gotham Café'' neatly answers the question of what could be worse than not getting a table at such a place. Other pieces in ''Everything's Eventual'' play to iffier, more acquired tastes. ''The Little Sisters of Eluria'' is a long sample of Mr. King's Dark Tower novels, and it tips more toward fantasy than anything else in the collection. ''Autopsy Room Four'' and ''1408'' are nearly generic horror, featuring a haunted hotel room and a Hitchcockian not-really-dead ''corpse,'' a man who has been paralyzed by a snake. ''All I wanted was 18 holes of golf on Saturday afternoon, and instead I turned into Snow White with hair on my chest,'' he thinks, wondering how he can deflect the autopsy team. He finds an X-rated way to do it. Mr. King's brand of earthiness also leads him to throw in conspiratorially disgusting little details -- about mucus, pus, bathroom data, whatever -- as a means of engaging the reader. He could throw these right back out again to no ill effect. Deserving of special mention here is Mark Stutzman's jacket illustration for ''Everything's Eventual'': a tranquil restaurant scene on the front cover with just a wee trace of blood in one water glass.

Viking, $25.95. Stephen King's fiction is crowded with ingenious monsters, but few of them are as disturbing as Norman Daniels, the lethal figure stalking the heroine of Mr. King's latest novel, ""Rose Madder."" In the book's first scene, having beaten his cowed, pregnant wife badly enough to induce a miscarriage, Norman blithely makes himself a sandwich while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. And when Rose suddenly flees, after 14 years of abuse, Norman calmly begins trolling for her, leaving in his wake a string of mutilated corpses. Rose doesn't leave Norman because she's afraid he'll kill her -- she's driven to escape by the fear that he won't, that his cruel torments will simply go on and on. Her despair, her gradual creation of a new life in a Midwestern city, her hesitant romance with a wry, gentle pawnbroker, are all convincingly rendered. The theme of abuse has given Mr. King's recent novels a welcome jolt of energy. There is real anger here in his depiction of the ways in which Rose's self-worth and independence are corroded, and in his account of the profound guilt she often feels. The novel also features an artful variation on Mr. King's use of the supernatural: Through the medium of a curious oil painting Rose discovers in the pawnshop, she is drawn into the realm of a goddess, a figure clearly inspired by classical mythology, who sets her a series of increasingly hazardous but salutary tasks. And when Norman finally tracks Rose down, it's the goddess who steps forward to settle accounts in a climax that is both grisly and surprisingly moving. RICHARD E.

15,Stephen King,2013-09-16,"Books of The Times By Janet Maslin In the author’s note that accompanies “Doctor Sleep,” Stephen King explains some of the obstacles he faced in writing this follow-up to “The Shining.” First, there were memory issues: Mr. King used an assistant to check all references to that earlier horror classic rather than rely on his own recall. And there was alcoholism, to which the memory issues were related. Before he became sober, Mr. King wrote many of his scariest books (“Salem’s Lot” in 1975, “The Shining” in 1977, “The Stand” in 1978) while in a purple haze. And it’s hard to write a new installment of a story that was blurry to begin with. He had two more demons to deal with. One was Stanley Kubrick, whose film version of “The Shining” is at least as well remembered as the novel with which it tampered. (Mr. King has made it clear that this is not his favorite film adaptation.) And perhaps worst of all, there was sequelitis. Even on the rare occasions when a sequel measures up to an original, it rarely gets credit for being any good. But Mr. King also undertook “Doctor Sleep” with a couple of clear advantages. One was a lack of baggage. The Overlook Hotel has burned to the ground, and the murderously writer’s-blocked Jack Torrance is dead. So is his wife, Wendy, which leaves only little Dan Torrance as a requisite figure for “Doctor Sleep.” And Mr. King had an easy way of approaching Dan’s story: He was the son of a violent drunk, and he had psychic powers that spooked him. Ergo, Dan must have become a drunk too. “Doctor Sleep” draws heavily on the writings and slogans of Alcoholics Anonymous as it presents Dan and his troubling legacy. Dan has also been sexually abused (with a nod to “N0S4A2,” the novel by Mr. King’s son Joe Hill) and receives brief but creepy visits from the last of the Overlook ghosts. This history, combined with a vague sense that he still has the Shining (i.e., psychic powers to detect the energy of other psychics and even meet them in some vaporous form), is more than Dan, now a young man, can bear. The book describes what happens when he hits bottom, inadvertently contributing to the death of a toddler because he’s too drunk to intervene. Dan then wanders his way into a New England town — and lands a hospice job that makes him the Doctor Sleep of the title. Dan’s powers can help ease dying patients as they “cycle” (the book’s word) out of this world. Since Dan’s boss insists on sobriety, the job can be seen as a blessing. But Mr. King doesn’t write whole books about nice things, does he? Also roaming through “Doctor Sleep” is a band of tetchy freaks, led by an evil beauty called Rose the Hat. This group calls itself the True Knot — or the True, when it’s feeling more like a rock band. True members nourish themselves with the “steam” that emanates from humans who have the Shining. Unfortunately, the best steam is harvested when those humans die in horrible pain. Add one more evanescence and the book’s setup is complete. A girl named Abra begins demonstrating paranormal powers from the time she is a baby. Abra, Dan and Rose are all capable of communicating on Mr. King’s way-cooler version of an astral plane: when any two of them are in touch, they can hear each other’s words without speaking, inhabit each other’s bodies, whatever. Dan and Abra are on the good side of this equation and Rose on the evil one. At least for starters. So “Doctor Sleep” has its own vivid frightscape, one that’s not too derivative of “The Shining.” And it’s scary enough to match the first book, though not better or scarier. Mr. King has in recent years created much more fully imagined characters than he did in his 100-proof horror days; “Under the Dome” was full of them. The trade-off has been a loss of bloodcurdling apparitions, like those in which “The Shining” specialized. By the way, Tony, Dan’s invisible friend, still lingers in the new book, as evidenced by the word “Redrum” scrawled on its back cover. That word still packs quite a wallop. “Doctor Sleep” is less panic-inducingly surreal. The adult Dan is, after all, struggling to keep his mind clear and to understand exactly what his supernatural capacities are. He’s also eager to make amends for that terrible, boozy lapse involving the toddler, a memory that haunts him as much as any of this book’s otherworldly creatures do. So even when he and Abra join forces to thwart the creeps from True Knot, it’s in a rational, even heroic way. “You may have some talents, you son of a bitch, but I don’t think you have much in the way of telepathy,” Dan says, speaking in Abra’s voice. (It’s complicated.) “I think when you want to talk to your girlfriend, you use the phone.”  This sequel takes life, aging and death too seriously to be a young man’s book. The same is true of its attitude toward sobriety, which is often discussed. Mr. King’s earlier books were full of phantasms and demons, but he grows ever more adept at rooting his dark thoughts and toughest struggles in reality. And when Abra goes into warrior mode, it’s not much of a fantasy stretch. She just models herself on a character from “Game of Thrones.”  “Doctor Sleep” is on the long side, but it tells a very quick and nimble story. It makes up in suspense what it lacks in nuance, and its special effects are easy to visualize. The body-switching among characters smacks of exorcism, though it has no religious component. The red mist secreted by the dying is terrifying to imagine. And the steam of those who Shine is one of Mr. King’s best surreal inventions. He remains amazingly resourceful. He’s so good at scaring that he can even raise goose bumps when he writes about the measles.  DOCTOR SLEEP By Stephen King 531 pages. Scribner. $30.",Doctor Sleep
16,Stephen King,2013-09-22," By Margaret Atwood “Doctor Sleep” is Stephen King’s latest novel, and it’s a very good specimen of the quintessential King blend. According to Vladimir Nabokov, Salvador Dalí was “really Norman Rockwell’s twin brother kidnapped by gypsies in babyhood.” But actually there were triplets: the third one is Stephen King. The Rockwell small-town rocking chair, the old-fashioned house with the welcome mat, the genial family doctor, the grandfather clock: there they are, depicted in all their lifelike, apparently cozy detail. Both Rockwell and King know such details intimately, right down to the brand names. But there’s something very, very wrong. The rocking chair is coming to get you. The family doctor is greenish in hue and has been dead for some time. The house is haunted, and the welcome mat is alive with things. And, pace Dalí, the clock is melting. “Doctor Sleep” picks up on the story of Danny, the little boy with psycho-intuitive powers in King’s famous 1977 novel, “The Shining.” Danny survived both his evil-infested dad, Jack Torrance, and the ghouls that inhabited the grisly Overlook Hotel in Colorado, escaping by the hair of his chinny-chin-chin just before the clock struck midnight and the hotel’s infernal boiler blew up, incinerating the forces of bad and leaving readers hiding under the bed, but cross-eyed with relief. In “Doctor Sleep” Dan has grown up, but he retains his “shining” abilities. Having wrestled the demon drink to an uneasy standstill — his father had that problem too, as we recall — he’s attending A.A. and working at a hospice facility, where, with his mind-probing talents, he helps the dying to reconcile themselves to their often misspent lives. Thus his nickname, Doctor Sleep, which echoes his childhood nickname, “doc.” (As in the “What’s up?” of Bugs Bunny fame. What, indeed?) Enter another magic child, Abra — as in “cadabra,” the text helpfully points out — who’s even better at the shining stuff than Dan is. She alarmed her parents early on by predicting the 9/11 disaster while still in her crib, and has since caused dismay by sticking all the spoons to the ceiling during her birthday party. The two shiners soon find themselves in spiritual communication, which is a lucky thing, because young Abra is going to need big help. She is the target of a rackety, entertaining bunch called the True Knot, who lust to drink her spiritual mist, or “steam.” (This is a whole new twist on steampunk.) The Knot members have been alive for a Very Long Time — not usually a good sign, as those who know their “Dracula” and “She” can testify — and, disguised as vacationers roaming the countryside in RVs, they kidnap and torture their victims, then imbibe their essences. They also bottle these in case of shortages; for if they run out of steam they evaporate, leaving their clothes behind, like the Wicked Witch of the West when melted. They’re led by a beautiful woman named Rose the Hat, whose main lover is a gent known as Crow Daddy. (From “crawdaddy,” we assume. King loves wordplay and puns and mirror language: remember redrum, from “The Shining”? Who could forget?) The names of King’s characters are frequently appropriate: Daniel “Lions’ Den” Anthony (the tempted saint) Torrance (it never rains but it pours) is a case in point. Rose is a sinister Rosa Mystica, a negative version of the Virgin Mary. (For starters, she ain’t no virgin.) As for the Overlook Hotel — on the site of which the True Knotters have pitched their main encampment — its name has at least three layers: the obvious one (it looks out over the landscape), the semi-obvious (the bad folks overlook something) and the deeply embedded, which I’m guessing has to do with the old song about the four-leaf clover and the somebody I adore; for King’s good-and-evil arrangement is usually yin and yang, with a spot of darkness in every goodie and a tiny ray of sunshine in every baddie. Even the True Knotters are sweet with one another, though their status as human beings is dubious. As one new recruit says, “Am I still human?” And as Rose replies, “Do you care?” Wild ectoplasmic partly decayed vampire horses would not tear from me the story of what happens next, but let me assure you King is a pro: by the end of this book your fingers will be mere stubs of their former selves, and you will be looking askance at the people in the supermarket line, because if they turn around they might have metallic eyes. King’s inventiveness and skill show no signs of slacking: “Doctor Sleep” has all the virtues of his best work. What are those virtues? First, King is a well-trusted guide to the underworld. His readers will follow him through any door marked “Danger: Keep Out” (or, in more literary terms, “Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here”), because they know that not only will he give them a thorough tour of the inferno — no gore left unspilled, no shriek left unshrieked — he will also get them out alive. As the Sibyl of Cumae puts it to Aeneas, it’s easy to go to hell, but returning from it is the hard part. She can say that because she’s been there; and, in a manner of speaking — our intuition tells us — so has King. Second, King is right at the center of an American literary taproot that goes all the way down: to the Puritans and their belief in witches, to Hawthorne, to Poe, to Melville, to the Henry James of “The Turn of the Screw,” and then to later exemplars like Ray Bradbury. In the future, I predict, theses will be written on such subjects as “American Puritan Neo-Surrealism in ‘The Scarlet Letter’ and ‘The Shining,’ ” and “Melville’s Pequod and King’s Overlook Hotel as Structures That Encapsulate American History.” Some may look skeptically at “horror” as a subliterary genre, but in fact horror is one of the most literary of all forms. Its practitioners read widely and well — King being a pre-eminent example — since horror stories are made from other horror stories: you can’t find a real-life example of the Overlook Hotel. People do “see” some of the things King’s characters see (for a companion volume, try Oliver Sacks’s “Hallucinations”), but it is one of the functions of “horror” writing to question the reality of unreality and the unreality of reality: what exactly do we mean by “see”? But dig down below the horror trappings, and “Doctor Sleep” is about families. The biological families of Dan and Abra, the “good” family of A.A., to which “Doctor Sleep” is a kind of love song, and the “bad” family of the True Knot. High on the list of King sins are the maltreatment of children by male relatives, and the brutalizing of women, mothers in particular. Righteous anger and destructive anger both have their focus in the family. As Doctor Sleep himself says to young Abra, “There’s nothing but family history”: often the narrative glue that sticks a King novel together. The family dimension, too, is quintessentially American-horror, all the way from “Young Goodman Brown” and “The Fall of the House of Usher” on up. What will King do next? Perhaps Abra will grow up, and become a writer, and use her “shining” talent to divine the minds and souls of others. For that, of course, is yet another interpretation of King’s eerie, luminescent metaphor. DOCTOR SLEEP By Stephen King 531 pp. Scribner. $30.

17,Stephen King,2013-06-23," By Walter Kirn The usual portal for wickedness and darkness in modern American horror fiction is youthful sexuality. Surging hormones summon demons. That’s why big-breasted baby sitters, once they’ve tucked the kids in and phoned their boyfriends to tell them to sneak over, had best keep an eye out for slashers on the stairs. That’s why campgrounds full of teenagers in shorts so often lure scar-faced intruders from the woods. Who are these monsters? The thwarted and the spurned, their psyches warped by repression and rejection. They feed for a while on others’ erotic vitality but are ultimately defeated by these same energies in the form of some brave lass or lad who drives a stake or fires a lucky shot, restoring health and order to the world. This is the basic pattern behind “Joyland,” Stephen King’s nostalgic new summer novel about the adventures of a lovelorn college boy in a haunted Southern amusement park. The book delivers chills, not shocks, and is silly-scary in the manner of a yarn that a sophomore might tell a freshman while toasting marshmallows around a fire. It’s an exercise in mock-Gothic Americana whose tone is more important than its plot, mostly because it barely has a plot, only occasional drafts of chilly menace. For most of the book, there’s not even a villain, just a diffuse sense of fairground creepiness that takes the place of a specific evildoer.  Our all-American hero is Devin Jones, a sensitive boy who’s since become a man and wants to tell us about that crazy time back in the innocent 1970s when he crossed a developmental threshold, simultaneously losing his virginity and gaining a mournful sense of life’s fragility. Devin, who dreamed of being a novelist but ended up as a writer for magazines, comes across as a version of King himself, which lends his narration a winking, intimate quality. The reader suspects Devin’s reminiscences of his formative summer at the carnival called Joyland stand for the sentimental education of the famous author of spooky novels.  Joyland is a quaint, old-fashioned establishment that offers rickety rides, rigged games of skill and other lurid but finally tame diversions, including a tunnel-of-love-like make-out spot, the Horror House. It was the scene of a murder a few years earlier when someone — someone still at large and possibly lurking — killed a young woman named Linda Gray and threw her body from a rattly car onto the dark tracks. Her restless ghost has never left the scene, sometimes materializing in souvenir pictures taken by a crew of girl photographers who give the park a naughty, sexy vibe. For Devin, the ghost is an instant source of intrigue and a welcome distraction from his obsession with an unavailable girl back home.  This is fairly light stuff, but what adds a layer of interest is King’s affection for the slang and customs of the midway. He’s an amateur anthropologist of carny life, relishing the rituals and folkways of a class on its way to near extinction: “I learned the Talk; I learned the geography, both above and below ground; I learned how to run a joint, take over a shy, and award plushies to good looking points.” A ride, in this lingo, is a “spree,” and a contest that’s stacked against the player is a “butcher’s game.” A bathroom is, for some reason, a “donniker.” Between the lines is an implied critique of the sanitized, corporate, Disney-style amusements that have supplanted the grass-roots titillations of an earlier, cruder era. Through Devin, who senses that Joyland’s days are numbered, King is lamenting the disappearance of a certain type of candid hucksterism not all that different in spirit from pulp fiction. Both forms of entertainment offer audiences the same delightfully democratic cheap thrills. As Devin learns from the masters of the trade who adopt him into their fraternity, the corny seductions of the carnival play on an abiding human desire to be honestly manipulated and charmingly ripped off. A failure with girls, who seem to find him bland, he could erotically profit from this wisdom, but his gallant good nature inhibits him, which may be related to his subsequent failure to make it as a novelist (a not entirely reputable profession that also involves taking people for a ride). Devin’s true knack is cheering up the kiddies, especially while costumed as a huge dog, which, in the parlance, is known as “wearing the fur.” It’s a noble calling, as Devin’s boss explains to him in a rather wooden speech that may as well be King’s own manifesto as a slinger of the ink: “This is a badly broken world, full of wars and cruelty and senseless tragedy. Every human being who inhabits it is served his or her portion of unhappiness and wakeful nights. . . . Given such sad but undeniable facts of the human condition, you have been given a priceless gift this summer: you are here to sell fun.” There’s not a lot more to “Joyland” than that, good fun. Even the impotent slayer of young women, once he’s unmasked by a freshly deflowered Devin, who’s finally discovered his male mojo thanks to a worldly older woman, is offered as a frightened object of pity. The novel is like a plump wad of cotton candy; it fills the mouth with fluffy sweetness that quickly dissolves when the reader starts to chew. That’s by design. King’s ambition this time around isn’t to snatch us and hold us in his grasp but to loft us up high, then briskly set us down the way a Ferris wheel does. Or a first love.

18,Stephen King,2009-11-08,"By JAMES PARKERNOV. 5, 2009 Now that the town halls have blazed with vituperation, and fantastical patriots are girding themselves for fascist/socialist lockdown, Americans of a certain vintage must be feeling a familiar circumambient thrill. Boomers, you know what I’m talking about: cranks empowered, strange throes and upthrusts, hyperbolic placards brandished in the streets — it’s the ’60s all over again! Once more the air turns interrogative: something’s happening here, but we don’t know what it is, do we, Mr. Jones? Stop, children, what’s that sound? In Stephen King’s new novel, “Under the Dome,” the people of Chester’s Mill, Me., get a letter from the president. Typically exalted in its rhetoric, it wrings a tear from at least one grateful citizen. But Big Jim Rennie, the town’s second selectman, is disgusted. He scowls at the printed sheet. Yep, there it is in black and white: “The bastard had signed it himself, and using all three of his names, including the terrorist one in the middle.” Why is Obama writing to Chester’s Mill? Because an enormous transparent dome, not breachable by prayer, bullet, laser beam or cruise missile, has suddenly and unaccountably descended over the town. Its provenance is uncertain (aliens? North Korea?), but its effect is incontrovertible: no one gets in, no one gets out. Some kind of energy field is attached to it; at close range it blows up iPods and (bad news for incautious oldsters) pace­makers, and sends a gust of “horripilation” through the human nervous system. Bummer, right? Not for the tyrant-in-waiting Big Jim and his pet goon squad. For them this is Christmas Day in the morning. Secession has occurred! The “thug in the White House,” the “Blackguard in Chief,” is on the other side of the dome, and Anytown, U.S.A. — with its meth factory, its profusion of religious denominations and its atavistic police department — is about to, as the phrase has it, “go rogue.” According to an author’s note, King took a first crack at “Under the Dome” in 1976, but gave it up “after two weeks’ work that amounted to about 75 pages.” An interesting sequence of expressions must have crossed his face when he watched “The Simpsons Movie” in 2007: here, in glowing animation, was a great glassy dome landing on a clueless municipality, a civic meltdown, etc. (“We’re trapped like rats!” screams Moe the bartender. “No,” says the man from the E.P.A., “rats can’t be trapped this easily. You’re trapped like . . . carrots.”) But the Simpsonian merriment bounced off him, apparently; King held on to his dome concept, waiting perhaps with his genius on “sleep” for our national politics to get a little more kinky, a little more vicious — a little more like a Stephen King novel. So this is it: 1,100 pages of localized apocalypse from an author whose continued and slightly frenzied commerce with his muse has been one of the more enthralling spectacles in American literature. King’s previous novel, “Duma Key” (2008), was a subterranean first-person trip, in the vein of “Misery” or “Bag of Bones”: Edgar Freemantle, rehabbing on the Florida coast after a construction accident that cost him his right arm and nearly his mind, starts banging out left-handed paintings whose Dalí-esque motifs have freaky real-world effects. Classic King: a maimed artistic consciousness, a symbolic journey. With “Under the Dome” we swoop up again to the God’s-eye view, or to the view of some equally altitudinous but less merciful entity — a panorama of interlocking stories and a huge cast of characters, many of them being used rather cruelly. As the values of the dome assert themselves, people become matter: a woman flies through a windshield “trailing intestines like party streamers,” another woman shoots herself in despair, leaving her brains drying on the wall “like a clot of oatmeal.” Big Jim, taking control of the Chester’s Mill police department, starts recruiting from the local pool of jocks and bully boys, “the ever-present football player rapist,” as the songwriter Gibby Haynes once put it. A town leader congratulates the chief of police on doing “a hell of a job.” Where is God in all this? Pastor Coggins, who flagellates himself and prays “in an ecstatic televangelist tremolo,” doesn’t last long; more durable, possibly because she doesn’t believe in God anymore, is the Rev. Piper Libby of the First Congregational Church. And holiest of all is Phil Bushey, known as the Chef, the heavily-armed meth wizard who commandeers the town’s Christian radio station. Chef, tweaking away, has some great lines: “God has told me this, Sanders,” he booms. “You’re in the Lord’s army now. . . . And I’m your superior. So report.” As for the prose, it’s not all smooth sailing. Given King’s extraordinary career-long dominance, we might expect him at this point to be stylistically complete, turning perfect sentences, as breezily at home in his idiom as P. G. Wodehouse. But he isn’t, quite. “Then it came down on her again, like unpleasant presents raining from a poison piñata: the realization that Howie was dead.” (It’s the accidental rhyme of “unpleasant” and “presents” that makes that one such a stinker.) I felt the clutch of sorrow, too, when I read this: “What you’re planning is terribly dangerous — I doubt if you need me to tell you that — but there may be no other way to save an innocent man’s life.” But then, King has always produced at pulp speed. “Nov. 22, 2007 - March 14, 2009” proclaims the final page of “Under the Dome”: that’s 1,100 pages in 480 days. We shouldn’t be too squeamish about the odd half-baked simile or lapse into B-movie dialogue, is my point. Writing flat-out keeps him close to his story, close to his source. It seems to magnetize his imagination: by the final third of this novel King is effortlessly drawing in T. S. Eliot and the Book of Revelation, the patient etherized upon a table and the Star Wormwood. Pollution thickens against the inner wall of the dome, and the sunset outside becomes alien and terrifying, a “vast, dusty glare.” The dome grows metaphysical — one character, contemplating the suffering of another, feels “a clinical sorrow, safely stored inside its own dome: you could see it, could appreciate its existence, but you couldn’t exactly get in there with it.” Big Jim Rennie, with his monster breakfasts and “carnivorously sociable smile,” is swept to power on a wave of homicide and municipal procedure. He snaps necks, and he attends emergency-assessment meetings (echoes here of Donald Antrim’s wildly black 1993 novel “Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World,” which begins with an ex-mayor being drawn and quartered by some inflamed Rotarians). He’s the worm in the brain of democracy: it takes him only four days to undo just about every­thing. The coalition that forms against him includes a journalist, a librarian, an Iraq veteran, some acned skateboarders and an English professor from Massachusetts who (rather wonderfully) has just edited an issue of Ploughshares. Get ready, libruls, King seems to be saying: If the dome comes down, you’re going to need one another.

19,Stephen King,2009-11-12,"By JANET MASLINNOV. 11, 2009 “Under the Dome” gravely threatens Stephen King’s status as a mere chart-busting pop cultural phenomenon. It has the scope and flavor of literary Americana, even if Mr. King’s particular patch of American turf is located smack in the middle of the Twilight Zone. It dispenses with his usual scatology and trippy fantasy to deliver a spectrum of credible people with real family ties, health crises, self-destructive habits and political passions. Even its broad caricatures prompt real emotion, if only via the damage they can inflict on others. Though the book’s broad conspiratorial strokes become farfetched, its ordinary souls become ever more able to break hearts. This book has the heft of a brick. It also has a premise that can be summarized in seconds. On a beautiful autumn day in Maine a transparent dome materializes over the town of Chester’s Mill. Once the Dome falls, all vestiges of normal life are suspended. Things run amok. They get scary. The townsfolk become fate’s playthings. And Mr. King, who can manipulate this crisis in any way that occurs to him, becomes a kid in a candy store. The premise provides so many options that Mr. King’s decisions about how to tell this story are of special interest. The King book that is most readily brought to mind by “Under the Dome” isn’t an earlier large-scale apocalyptic fantasy like “It” or “The Stand”; it’s “On Writing,” the instructive autobiographical gem that cast light on how Mr. King’s creative mind works. In the spirit of “On Writing,” “Under the Dome” takes a lucid, commonsense approach that keeps it tight and energetic from start to finish. Hard as this thing is to hoist, it’s even harder to put down. Consider the book’s step-by-step way of defining the Dome. Mr. King isn’t about to do the easy thing, which would be to give a straightforward description of what it is and how it works. Instead he offers a textbook demonstration of how  to make action and explication one and the same.  First step: A woodchuck on the ground and a pilot in the air named Chuck are sudden victims of the Dome’s guillotinelike slicing descent. Second step: The book’s hero to be, a short-order cook and Iraq war veteran named Dale Barbara, looks upward. He sees the front of Chuck’s plane fall off and the back get crushed by the invisible barrier that, we now know, reaches sky high. Big sigh of relief here: Dome calamities, while definitely deadly, will not be (by Mr. King’s high standards in this area) described gruesomely at all. Third step: Barbara, a k a Barbie, waves frantically to a stranger for help. The stranger walks right toward him — and smashes into an invisible wall. So the Dome’s extent is making itself known. Then Mr. King defines the perimeter by ticking off the various roads that lead to Chester’s Mill. “And shortly before noon on Dome Day,” he writes, now attaching a name to this calamity, “every one of them snapped closed.” With the same tight efficiency, Mr. King goes on to introduce the various businesses (restaurant, newspaper), institutions (hospital) and officials (police and town selectmen) on the Chester’s Mill map. “Under the Dome” even comes with a map, but the town in the narrative is much too sharply drawn to need one. Special editions of this book also come with playing cards featuring illustrations of the main characters in this story’s huge cast, among them its mega-villain, a used-car salesman and diabolically devious second selectman known as Big Jim Rennie. He has been drawn to look just like Dick Cheney. The Dome traps the air in Chester’s Mill. But for Big Jim it creates an exploitable vacuum. His power grab is soon under way, and just in case that isn’t sinister enough, Big Jim’s son, Junior, turns out to have homicidal tendencies. Meanwhile Mr. King’s neighborly array of well-sketched locals intertwine in dozens of subplots, to the point where Chester’s Mill really does seem to operate as one cohesive organism. When the local storekeeper and huckster decides that Dome Day’s famine-inducing possibilities can help him unload a lot of old hot dogs, someone at the hospital is told to “expect an influx of gastroenteritis patients this evening.”  All of this — along with the smog that starts to choke off Chester’s Mill and make the Dome as visible as a dirty windshield — is a way of blowing smoke. It gets Mr. King through nearly 1,100 fast-moving pages without his having to answer the obvious questions: what is this thing? How did it get here? Why  did it get here? What if it doesn’t go away? “Under the Dome” can’t avoid these thoughts forever. But it can postpone them with an ease that is one more measure of its author’s having placed more value on humanity than on horror. “Under the Dome” has a well-stocked emotional arsenal. It also has a great capacity for escapist fun, without which Mr. King could never lure readers through such a long trek. As usual he takes every opportunity to dispense winks and shout-outs, and he summons whichever cult-favorite references strike his fancy. A Warren Zevon lyric crops up; so does James McMurtry’s red-hot “Talkin’ at the Texaco,” which immortalizes a gritty, sidelong small-town spirit and might as well be this book’s theme song. The local Christian radio station usually plays music that is, in Mr. King’s opinion, straight from Hell. And one tough female police officer has been hired on the recommendation of a certain Jack Reacher, said to have been the toughest darn cop the Army ever saw. Big currents flow through this book along with the small ones. There are echoes of 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and  Iraq that help to shape this small town’s view of the wider world. News  crews (notably CNN’s) arrive at the perimeter of the Dome to stake out this colossal human-interest story. And what they observe, on a visiting day when loved ones outside of Chester’s Mill are allowed to venture near the Dome’s dangerous surface, conveys  genuine tragedy. As Mr. King puts it, describing what the TV cameras see: “They observe the townspeople and the visitors pressing their hands together, with the invisible barrier between; they watch them try to kiss; they examine men and women weeping as they look into each other’s eyes; they note the ones who faint, both inside the Dome and out, and those who fall to their knees and pray facing each other with their folded hands raised; they record the man on the outside who begins hammering his fists against the thing keeping him from his pregnant wife, hammering until his skin splits and his blood beads on thin air; they peer at the old woman trying to trace her fingers, the tips pressed white and smooth against the unseen surface between them, over her sobbing granddaughter’s forehead.” Nowhere in Mr. King’s immense body of work have his real and fantasy worlds collided with such head-on force.

20,Stephen King,2014-11-14,"Books of The Times By Janet Maslin You can fall down a very deep rabbit hole just pondering the list of names to whom Stephen King dedicates “Revival,” his second skin-crawler published this year. (“Mr. Mercedes” arrived in June.) Some, like Bram Stoker and H. P. Lovecraft, are familiar. Others, like August Derleth, the author of more than 100 books that Mr. King must have devoured as a boy and a seminal figure in the creation of Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos horror genre, are so far out of the mainstream that they can prompt long, dreamy voyages of discovery.  By all means look up Robert Bloch or Derleth if you’d like to have more insight into what shaped Mr. King’s young imagination. But don’t do it until his new book, tenderly realistic despite its roots in horror and science fiction, has had its way with you. And steer clear of the ageless 1890 short novel that Mr. King says inspired “Revival” if you don’t want to kill its chances of scaring the hell out of you. Mr. King has the wind at his back again. He hit the doldrums with “Doctor Sleep” (2013), his sequel to “The Shining.” And  “Duma Key” (2008) seemed to have more to do with his spending time in the part of Florida the book describes than with any burning need to tell a story. But the trifecta of “Joyland” (2013), “Mr. Mercedes” and now “Revival,” the best of the bunch, finds him writing with the infectious glee that has always been at the heart of his popular success. How many writers have a biography that can begin something like this: “Stephen King is the author of more than 50 books, all of them worldwide best sellers.”?  Happily, he no longer confuses big books with long ones. He does not ramble on, as he did with “Dreamcatcher” and “Duma Key,” which at 600-plus pages each both seemed endless. “Under the Dome,” his best behemoth of recent years, might have been 1,074 pages, but each one was worth it. “Revival” is much shorter, but it, too, is a well-built book that unfolds on a big canvas. It spans much of the lifetime of Jamie Morton, a Maine boy who is roughly Mr. King’s contemporary. It has a small cast of characters and a length to suit that. The book begins by comparing a person’s life to a movie, so that the leading characters are family and friends; supporting players are neighbors and acquaintances; bit players are walk-ons. But there are also wild cards. And they break all the rules. “Revival” begins so benignly that Mr. King must warn the reader to watch out for Jamie’s perpetual nemesis, a kindly clergyman calling himself the Rev. Charles Jacobs. The year is 1962. Jamie is 6, playing with soldier toys during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Reverend stops by to introduce himself. He invites Jamie’s family to attend his Methodist church and also has Jamie visit his garage to see the toys he has been inventing. The Reverend loves electricity. Using a photoelectric cell, he’s built a model of what he calls Peaceable Lake and a miniature Jesus who can walk on water.  Jamie is smitten; so is the Reverend, who is madly in love with his beautiful wife and little son. But three years later there is trouble in paradise: the Reverend’s experiments have taken a turn toward miracle cures, and he dares to suggest that electricity is more powerful than God. The Mortons adore him for having restored the voice of Jamie’s older brother after a terrible accident involving a ski pole — but nobody knows exactly what happens over the long run to people cured by the Reverend after he has run electrical currents through them. And then, the worst possible bolt from the blue: A terrible accident takes the Reverend’s wife and child from him and turns him into a different man. Raging and heartbroken, he gives a blasphemous but honest sermon that shakes the faith of all who hear it. And then he vanishes. Years go by; Jamie becomes a teenager in love, a rock musician and a drug addict. In a section of the book that seems written from intact and swooningly romantic memory, Mr. King summons the sensations of first sexual lightning that will never leave the heart and soul. Charles Jacobs is gone, and yet weirdly present, since Jamie and his teenage lover meet for trysts on the mountaintop most likely to be hit by electrical storms. In the 1990s, their paths cross when Jacobs crops up in Tulsa with a new name, Dan Jacobs, new cynicism and new occupation: flimflam man at state fairs. He cons audiences with electricity-based magic tricks, and he’s figured out that this is a good way to continue his scientific experiments. Since Jamie is by now a raging addict and Dan is able to cure him, Jamie is forever in the debt of someone he knows to be a man of bad faith. Jamie, like Mr. King (as he has said in recent interviews), wants to believe in a higher power, especially as an ex-addict who could not conquer drugs without that higher power’s help. It all gets worse. Jacobs’s next incarnation is that of a tent-show preacher doling out miracle cures — and soaking the gullible for so much money that he has become a very rich and creepy recluse. The only person in the world about whom he seems to care is Jamie, and he weaves an elaborate spider’s web to draw Jamie back into his world. The last part of the book moves from the raw emotion about family, love, aging and lost opportunity — all of it written with unusual candor, even for Mr. King — to the horror legacy of those names to whom the book is dedicated. And if you have read this far, you may as well know that Arthur Machen’s short novel “The Great God Pan,” which Mr. King says “has haunted me all my life,” inspires a nightmare of a finale. “Revival” winds up with the idea that to be human, you must know what it is to be inhuman — and to know that only this thin partition separates that horror from ordinary life. So it’s not just a book that delivers its share of jolts and then lets the reader walk away unscathed. Older and wiser each time he writes, Mr. King has moved on from the physical fear that haunted him after he was struck by a van while out walking to a more metaphysical, universal terror. He writes about things so inevitable that he speaks to us all. REVIVAL By Stephen King 405 pages. Scribner. $30.",Revival
21,Stephen King,2014-11-23," By Danielle Trussoni There is a children’s joke that goes something like this: Why was Dr. Frankenstein never lonely?  Answer: Because he was good at making friends. The same might be said for novelists, whose solitary days of writing can lead — if the work is going well — to the creation of amusing companions. From Mary Shelley’s monster to Bram Stoker’s vampire, every variety of bizarre creature can come creeping up when a writer closes out reality and lets the imagination take over. If loneliness is to blame, then Stephen King, who has created some of the most entertaining characters of any writer of his generation, must be one solitary guy.  “Revival,” King’s 55th novel, introduces a fellow solitary genius, the Rev. Charles Jacobs, a Frankenstein-like mad scientist who sets out to decipher the “secret of the universe” and the “path to ultimate knowledge” by harnessing and using a “secret electricity” to open “doorways to the infinite.” Jacobs is a man obsessed, ready to sacrifice the entire human race to get what he wants. But first things first. Before divine knowledge, Jacobs needs to understand the basic principles of his special electricity. Thus Jamie Morton, the book’s narrator and a longtime observer of Charles Jacobs, finds himself a guinea pig in Jacobs’s evil experiments. Before Jamie realizes the true nature of the work, Jacobs puts a plastic mouth guard between Jamie’s lips, slips on some headphones and shoots a powerful dose of electricity into his brain.  The shock is meant to cure Jamie’s heroin addiction, but — this being a Stephen King novel, and Jamie being our only window into Jacobs’s derangement — the effects are far more nefarious. Jamie wakes up disorientated, his thoughts scrambling: “Something, something, something. Happened. Happened. Something happened. Something happened, happened, something happened. Happened. Something.”  The something, at first glance, appears to be that Jamie’s “brain had gone wrong.” In fact, the reader soon learns, Jamie’s trauma has little to do with brain freeze and everything to do with Jacobs’s secret electricity, which isn’t just a supercharged panacea but something far scarier. Jamie’s 30-second detox has made him an integral part of Jacobs’s sinister master plan.  Their relationship began long before, when Jamie was 6 and Jacobs was the minister of his community parish in small-town Maine. In the beginning, the reverend was a good and holy man. He led the Harlow Methodist Youth, where he taught the children the mysteries of God via lessons in electricity. Back then, before disillusionment and madness set in, Jacobs’s interest in electricity was purely metaphorical; lightning was an analogy for the divine. Explaining electrons and atoms, he would conclude that “science is fine, but it’s also finite. There always comes a point where knowledge runs out.” And into this vacuum divine knowledge rushed. Electricity led to the infinite. Open the door and there waits God, a big grin on his face. While Jacobs may have started out with good intentions, these quickly turn dark after a random auto accident on a quiet country road kills Jacobs’s family, destroying his faith and maybe his sanity. (King’s longtime fans will recognize shades of “Pet Sematary” in the accident and the hand of fate.) Jacobs loses his religious conviction, tells his parish that “religion is the theological equivalent of a quick-buck insurance scam,” and spends the next several decades working amusement parks and carny circuits, healing the sick by administering small amounts of electricity to their brains. Jacobs’s belief that “all diseases are electrical in nature” and “electricity is the basis of all life” proves correct, and he becomes a miracle worker, healing the sick as he pursues his private — and much less altruistic — experiments. Jacobs’s purpose? “I want to know what happened to my wife and son,” he explains. “I want to know what the universe has in store for all of us once this life is over.” Jacobs has lost his faith in everything but science.  Readers will find in Jacobs’s behavior echoes not only of “Pet Sematary” but also, and more strongly, of “Frankenstein,” which King openly references. Whereas “Frankenstein” is subtitled “The Modern Prometheus,” a reference to the dangers of approaching divine knowledge, “Revival” could easily be subtitled “The Modern Frankenstein.” Like Jacobs, Dr. Frankenstein uses electricity (or galvanism, as the occult study of electricity was called in the 18th century) to power his experiment. Frankenstein, too, is grieving untimely deaths in his family. And like Frankenstein, Jacobs is none too happy with the ultimate results of his experiment.  Yet “Revival” is pure Stephen King. Like many of King’s novels, it is filled with cultural allusions both high and low: In addition to the Bible and “Frankenstein,” there are references to Thomas Edison’s work at Menlo Park, Dan Brown, “The X Files,” the “Forbidden Books” (that is, grimoires banned and burned by the Catholic Church) and particularly Ludvig Prinn’s “The Mysteries of the Worm,” which the American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft used as the basis of his fictional grimoire “Necronomicon.” If you’re one of those readers who, like me, look up references as they read, you’ll find that most of these story elements are — as Jamie tells us — easily verifiable. As the Kingian references pile up, and become layered into the events of the fictional world, you fall deeper and deeper under the story’s spell, almost believing that Jamie’s nightmarish experiences actually happened.  That said, while I love a good mad scientist, I found Charles Jacobs less harrowing than other of King’s characters. He doesn’t linger with the grim malevolence of, for example, Jack Torrance (“The Shining”) or Annie Wilkes (“Misery”). Perhaps this is because the target of Jacobs’s madness is too often abstract — he’s aiming to understand divine knowledge and death itself, and will go to any lengths to do so, even if he destroys humankind. I may be alone here, but the threat of species extinction felt far less terrifying than the act of strapping Jamie Morton down and frying his brain until he couldn’t put a sentence together. Jacobs is more brutal, and thus more thrilling, when his lunacy finds an individual outlet and we, the readers, experience the particular dangers of that lunacy. At times like these, one can’t help feeling that Jacobs enjoys the pain he causes, that he’s having some really twisted fun. And so too King. Reading “Revival” is experiencing a master storyteller having the time of his life. All of his favorite fictional elements are at play — small-town Maine, the supernatural, the evil genius, the obsessive addict, the power of belief to transform a life. King even plays games with his characters’ names, calling one character Shelley, another Victor and another Mary, recasting his inspirations — Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein — into his own fictional universe. For the reader, it is fun to map it all out, to experience King’s mind at work. For King, these inside jokes might offer some relief from the solitude of writing, a way to laugh alone at the keyboard when nobody else is watching. I’d like to imagine all of these characters keeping vigil at the edge of Stephen King’s desk, keeping him company as he writes them into existence.  REVIVAL By Stephen King 405 pp. Scribner. $30.

22,Stephen King,2006-11-12,"By JIM WINDOLFNOV. 12, 2006 Stephen King has written about zombies, vampires and the end of the world. He has imagined a killer car, a killer dog, a killer clown and killer cellphones. But when he really wants to put a scare into you, he brings on his most fearsome monster of all, that quivering mass of ego and insecurity known as ... the writer. King’s writers have a tendency to serve as conduits to the supernatural world, which usually results in sprees of violence. All that heady dreaming at the desk, the author seems to suggest, leaves the flesh open to corruption. Think of Jack Torrance, the short-tempered playwright of “The Shining” (1977). One moment he finds himself working, confusedly, on a five-act play, and the next moment he’s chasing his wife and young son with a mallet at the behest of vengeful shades. Or take Thaddeus Beaumont, the mild-mannered novelist of “The Dark Half” (1989), who finds material success only when he adopts a nom de plume. Thaddeus revels in the freedom to write “any damn thing I pleased without The New York Times Book Review looking over my shoulder,” but then his alter ego springs to life and goes on a killing rampage. In a 1993 essay, King wrote: “The question which haunts and nags and won’t completely let go is this one: Who am I when I write?” The same question lies at the heart of his new novel. Scott Landon, the fragile, prize-winning novelist at the book’s core, answers it like this: “I am crazy. I have delusions and visions. ... I write them down and people pay me to read them.” In “Lisey’s Story,” King once again finds terror in the creative act, but for the first time he sees beauty there, too. Our heroine is Scott’s 50-year-old widow, Lisey Debusher Landon. At first she comes across as dutiful and drab, and it seems almost as if King prepared to write this book by mainlining a batch of Anne Tyler. But soon enough there’s a werewolf-like character chained in a basement, a patricide and a stalker who speaks (like previous King villains) with a Southern twang. In due course Lisey finds she must take up arms against the stalkers of this world and face a blood-hungry beast in the world beyond. Lisey and Scott become truly close to each other when he cuts his left hand, purposely and severely, and shows her the blood. He does this one night early in their relationship to atone for having kept her waiting. “It’s a bool, Lisey!” That’s what he tells her. “And not just any bool, it’s a blood-bool!” She thinks he’s crazy, but the “blood-bool” eventually leads her to Boo’ya Moon, a fantastic realm to which Scott escaped as a boy when his cruel father sliced him in his attempts to release “the bad gunky.” Lisey has three sisters, one of whom is kooky, and at times “Lisey’s Story” feels like “The Ya-Ya Sisterhood Goes to Hell.” If King’s 1982 novella “The Body” was his song of praise to boyhood and vomit, then “Lisey’s Story” is his ode to sisterhood and blood. At another level it’s about one writer’s anxiety. Who am I when I write? When King was a boy, his classmates paid to read the scary stories he wrote. Then came his first brush with a critic — Miss Hisler, the school principal. King describes the scene in “On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft” (2000): “ ‘What I don’t understand, Stevie,’ she said, ‘is why you’d write junk like this in the first place.’ ” Instead of strengthening his resolve, Miss Hisler’s words cut him deep: “I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years since — too many, I think — being ashamed about what I write.” As a young man, he sold short stories not to The New Yorker or Esquire but to Cavalier, Dude and Swank. Living in a double-wide trailer with his wife and two small children, King pumped out novels no one wanted in his hours away from a high-school teaching job and summertime stints at an industrial laundry. Then came “Carrie” (1974), which he sold to Doubleday for $2,500. When Signet paid $400,000 for the paperback rights, he became Stephen King, the brand name — but that didn’t mean he could set foot in the House of Literature. His stuff appealed to people more familiar with Aerosmith than “Arrowsmith,” and the literary gatekeepers didn’t approve. In public pronouncements King was sometimes unrepentant: “I recognize terror as the finest emotion,” he wrote in his study of the horror field, “Danse Macabre” (1981), “and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find I cannot terrify him/her, I will try to horrify, and if I find I cannot horrify, I’ll go for the gross-out. I’m not proud.” But in a later essay he complained of “being dismissed by the more intellectual critics as a hack (the intellectual’s definition of a hack seems to be ‘an artist whose work is appreciated by too many people’).” The act of writing itself, for King, turned into something shameful and disgusting. He wrote, heart racing, with cotton shoved into his nostrils to sop up the cocaine-induced bleeding. His desk became the slum of his household: “For six years I sat behind that desk either drunk or wrecked out of my mind, like a ship’s captain in charge of a voyage to nowhere,” he wrote. In the early ’90s, after having apparently kicked his addictions, he started to add the influential few to his millions of admirers. He made his way into small-circulation prestige rags like Antaeus and Tin House. He won a 1996 O. Henry Award for a story he had published in The New Yorker. In 2003, the National Book Foundation gave him its medal for distinguished contribution to American letters, which offended the critic Harold Bloom, who said: “He is a man who writes what used to be called penny dreadfuls. That they could believe that there is any literary value there or any aesthetic accomplishment or signs of an inventive human intelligence is simply a testimony to their own idiocy.” Beneath Bloom’s notice, however, a cultural shift had taken place. Everything was up for reassessment. Music critics re-examined the supposed schlock of the ’70s (Abba, Led Zeppelin, Donna Summer) and found some value there. Martin Amis wrote a love song to the crime writer Elmore Leonard. The Modern Library and the Library of America issued handsome hardcover editions of Raymond Chandler. Quentin Tarantino delivered cheap thrills guised as le cinéma. Paul McCartney composed classical pieces while the opera singer Andrea Bocelli had multiplatinum sales. The French dug up the coffin containing the remains of Alexandre Dumas, that best-selling scoundrel, and carried it to the Pantheon. Cormac McCarthy, one of the few living novelists to have met with Bloom’s approval, left behind the tangled style of “Blood Meridian” and “Suttree” to update the Western with his Border Trilogy; he has since ventured deeper into genre territory with the one-two punch of “No Country for Old Men” and “The Road.” Another of Bloom’s pets, Philip Roth, borrowed a conceit from science fiction in using an alternate reality as the jumping-off point for “The Plot Against America.” And the Red Sox won the World Series.  Writers who had grown up on King, like Michael Chabon, got the c’mere finger from the literary establishment. As editor of two anthologies put out under Dave Eggers’s McSweeney’s concern, Chabon selected stories by King to run alongside those by writers whose work is filed under “literary” (Rick Moody, Charles D’Ambrosio, et al.). The collections’ titles, “McSweeney’s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories” and “McSweeney’s Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales,” suggested a nostalgia not for the modernist Little Review, which published Joyce and Pound and claimed to make “no compromise with the public taste,” but for relics of American trash culture like Weird Tales, Argosy and Amazing Stories. At the National Book Foundation ceremony, the bard of Bangor made sure his audience knew he stood outside the tribe: “The only person who understands how much this award means to me is my wife, Tabitha,” he said in his acceptance speech. “She also understands why I was in those early days so often bitterly angry at writers who were considered ‘literary.’ I knew I didn’t have quite enough talent or polish to be one of them, so there was an element of jealousy, but I was also infuriated by how these writers always seemed to have the inside track in my view at that time. Even a note in the acknowledgments page of a novel thanking this or that foundation for its generous assistance was enough to set me off.” This year, King was granted the privilege of a Paris Review interview. On the ticklish subject of his literary worth, he said, “I’m shy talking about this, because I’m afraid people will laugh and say, Look at that barbarian trying to pretend he belongs in the palace.” Paul Sheldon, the writer-hero of King’s “Misery” (1987), also has anxieties about his reputation. Paul has written literary novels, but he suspects he’s better suited to churning out popular bodice-rippers centered on his plucky, Victorian-era heroine, Misery Chastain: “The truth, should you insist, was that the increasing dismissal of his work in the critical press as that of a ‘popular writer’ ... had hurt him quite badly. It didn’t jibe with his self-image as a Serious Writer who was only churning out these ... romances in order to subsidize his (flourish of trumpets, please!) REAL WORK! Had he hated Misery? Had he really? ... Perhaps all he had hated was the fact that her face on the dust jackets had overshadowed his in his author photographs, not allowing the critics to see that they were dealing with a young Mailer or Cheever here. ... As a result, hadn’t his ‘serious fiction’ become steadily more self-conscious, a sort of scream? Look at me! Look how good this is! Hey, guys!” King has yet to write a bodice-ripper, but any novelist who trots out demons and dragons is asking for trouble with critics. One writer who got away with it while winning applause from here to Stockholm was Isaac Bashevis Singer. He wrote about devils, imps and dybbuks partly to suggest the influence of unseen forces over everyday events and partly because he loved a good yarn. “I am not a slice-of-life writer,” Singer said in his Paris Review interview. Not every tale about a dybbuk or zombie pulls its weight, however. The ones that do are those that match up with psychological truths. When Jack Torrance of “The Shining” agrees to do the bidding of the revenants inhabiting the Overlook Hotel, readers go along for the ride because the homicidal shades’ commands match up neatly with the unconscious desires of a short-tempered family man who has a bad case of cabin fever. The oldest tales in the Western canon function in the same way. “Hansel and Gretel,” for instance, is an unforgettable story because it fleshes out our childhood fears of abandonment and our suspicions of what horrors await us in the wider world. That’s why we believe in the cannibal witch and her edible cottage. That’s why we unhesitatingly surrender ourselves to the tale’s unreality, the Grimms’ willing dupes. King has said he wrote “The Shining” out of his worry that he would harm his own children. That’s a taboo fear dealt with by every parent not up for sainthood, and the book’s supernatural characters give weight to it. Another of King’s supernatural novels to have a writer for its hero, “Bag of Bones,” is not so convincing, because its ghosts arise from a fear sociopolitical rather than primal in origin. “Bag of Bones” posits that the winners of capitalism’s lottery, like the novel’s protagonist, a middlebrow best-selling writer named Mike Noonan, don’t give a thought to the past crimes (in this case, racially motivated lynchings and rapes) that have paved the way for their bourgeois comforts, like Mike’s lakeside summer home. “Bag of Bones” was maybe the first horror novel of liberal guilt. It’s admirable in its theme but it never comes alive in Brothers Grimm fashion. “Lisey’s Story” succeeds where “Bag of Bones,” its fraternal twin, failed. Both books are supernatural love stories focused on mourning and marriage. But Lisey and Scott make much better novel subjects than their “Bag of Bones” counterparts. They are loopy and dramatic. Unlike the couple in the earlier book, who are chewed up by creaky plot machinery, Lisey and Scott are the story. They fit F. Scott Fitzgerald’s dictum, “Action is character.” In the afterword to “Lisey’s Story,” King, post-coitally chatty after more than 500 pages, challenges reviewers to check his first draft against the final version to see how rigorously it was edited (by Scribner’s Nan Graham). “I had first-year French essays that came back cleaner,” he writes. Despite her red pen, the novel has its lulls, its repetitions, its gratuitous explanations. A few unfortunate lines remain, for example, “Amanda sounded just as bright as a new-minted penny.” (Cut to Bloom, spitting out his morning coffee.) But give him a break: King is a volcano. Let his new admirers play Flaubert to his Hugo. “Lisey’s Story” has an abundance of solid descriptions (“His mouth tastes like the inside of a piggybank”) and indelible images (a boy burying a corpse with a toy shovel). Throughout, King is as cagey as a veteran pitcher, employing a career’s worth of tricks to good effect. He ends chapters midsentence, slips in and out of italics, breaks into verse, deftly changes tenses and switches perspectives and narrators the better to carve out his big story. The scenes of Lisey’s courtship and marriage are realistic and strange, and the sections set in the Boo’ya Moon netherworld, a place scented with bougainvillea and frangipani, are persuasive and enchanting. Boo’ya Moon is “this world turned inside-out like a pocket,” and it’s as real as J. M. Barrie’s Never-Never Land, L. Frank Baum’s Oz or the Grimms’ forest. Like those places, Boo’ya Moon arises from childhood longings for the things not provided by one’s parents or guardians, and it’s as forbidding as it is wonderful. You come away from “Lisey’s Story” convinced of the existence of King’s fantastic realm and of something else rarer still in fiction, a long, happy marriage.

23,Stephen King,2008-11-05,"By JANET MASLINNOV. 4, 2008 Most people think of the roadside rest area as a functional place to stop during a long drive. Not Stephen King. Mr. King sees potential nightmares in even the most mundane experiences. And his new collection of short stories mines the rest-stop idea  to the max. Of the 13 stories in “Just After Sunset,” one entirely revolves around a bathroom break. One uses a rest area as a crucial turning point in its suspense plot. And one is the retch-worthy tale of a man locked inside a tipped-over, heavily used Portosan. “I even grossed myself out,” Mr. King says of that last one in his notes about the book. Quite a feat. His gross-out threshold is a whole lot higher than yours. In any case, he is a tireless storyteller. One tale in this collection was written during a few hours’ lag time in a hotel room in Australia, just because he had time to kill. Mr. King’s introduction explains that his new surge of short-story writing was prompted by the job of editing the 2006 volume in the Best American Short Stories series . He wondered whether he still had the knack of miniaturization and decided to find out. And simple, everyday situations became his open portals to fantasy and horror. Even a stationary exercise bicycle yields a richly scarifying tale. There are specific fears that haunt this succinct, fast-moving collection. Two stories find Mr. King trying to convey the terrors of 9/11, one in a stark visual evocation (a sight that is “in very poor taste,” according to a Connecticut matron who witnesses it), and the other in a ghostly exploration of the event’s aftermath. Two others expand on the possibilities of obsessive-compulsive disorder by summoning it viscerally. You’ll know this book is having the desired effect when you can’t write down the numbers that the number-obsessed main character in “N.” deems terribly unlucky. “For all I knew, that flattened snakehead with the pink eyes and what looked like great long quills growing out of its snout was only a baby,”  writes Mr. King at his wicked best. The prospect of a sentence like that is what keeps his fans die-hard, even when a book is more of a quota-filler than a consistently top-flight collection. After all, “Just After Sunset” also features an action story that includes the following exchange of dialogue: “Don’t.” “Yes.” “Stop.” “No.” Not to mention: “I’ll lift your eye right out of its socket and flip it into the sink.” In “Just After Sunset” Mr. King must work more quickly and efficiently than he has in recent sprawling novels. And the mechanics of his methods are illuminatingly exposed. For the main rest-stop story he chose the title “Rest Stop” and grafted the rest-stop experience onto the psyche of a writer who has two identities: his Clark Kent-ish real self and the tough-guy character in his novels. When he sees a man brutally bullying a woman, the real man is paralyzed; the hero leaps into action. And Mr. King wryly acknowledges that “Don’t hurt me, mister” is a line that a writer is likelier to find on the page than hear in real life. It is a testament to Mr. King’s fear-soaked psyche that the least interesting thing his characters can do is be dead. Sure, he does a few obligatory “Twilight Zone”-style tricks of this sort: One person gets wind of his own demise when he figures out that he can’t buy cigarettes, and one tale centers on a dead person’s ability to use the telephone. But those aren’t the good parts. Mr. King can pull such stunts in his sleep. Speaking of the somnolent: this book also includes a nightmare story that delivers a double-whammy. It describes a frightful dream that reveals someone’s death. This collection’s most successful stories start unprepossessingly but then head for unknown territory, off in the far reaches of Mr. King’s imagination. The escalation of these narratives is carefully calibrated. Take “Stationary Bike,” which originated in what Mr. King calls “my hate/hate relationship not just with stationary bikes but with every treadmill I ever trudged and every Stairmaster I ever climbed.” The bike may have been his enemy, but tedium is his friend. So he writes of how a man named Richard Sifkitz visits his doctor. And the doctor gives Sifkitz a baby-talk version of a medical prognosis. High cholesterol is straining his patient’s body, the doctor says. He adds: “It helps at this point to think of the metabolic process as a work crew. Men in chinos and Doc Martens.” This may sound silly to Sifkitz, but it’s an idea that soon takes over his imagination. So he pedals away, conjuring a full cast of little men who work in the blood-vessel maintenance business. Soon he is hooked on strenuous exercise and is pedaling past vivid roadside scenery, even though the bike is in a basement. As in his most recent novel, “Duma Key,” Mr. King also lets a mysteriously changeable picture tell his story, and Sifkitz’s vision becomes more and more elaborate as he rides along. The denouement takes a turn away from horror to arrive at Sifkitz’s happy compromise about what he has to do to stay alive. The stories in “Just After Sunset” are varied in ways that reflect the publications in which they first appeared. “Harvey’s Dream,” from The New Yorker, is unusually polished. And it is quietly eloquent about a glum, middle-age marriage. “Willa,” which has the most heavy-handed final twist, appeared in Playboy. And “N.” is the text of an original graphic video series, which means you can watch parts of it on the Internet. It will eventually become a comic book. You can watch it or you can read it on a dark and stormy night and shiver. Regardless of format, that’s the effect. JUST AFTER SUNSET Stories By Stephen King 367 pages. Scribner. $28.

24,Stephen King,2008-11-23,"By CHARLES TAYLORNOV. 21, 2008 If the prospect of a collection of stories by Stephen King isn’t as inviting as a new King novel, it’s not just because the writer’s recent novels — “Duma Key,” “Lisey’s Story” and especially “Cell” and “From a Buick 8” — have been so good. It’s because King continues to be dedicated to giving his readers a luxuriant experience, the basic pleasure of getting lost in a book. In his introduction to the new collection “Just After Sunset,” King explains that as a young almost-poor schoolteacher trying to get a writing career started, stories, many of them published in men’s magazines like Dude and Cavalier, were a way to a much needed check when the car needed a muffler or his wife’s birthday was coming up. King says the stories simply came out, and he wasn’t too concerned with learning what constituted good structure. “I was flying entirely by the seat of my pants,” he writes, “running on nothing but intuition and a kid’s self-confidence.” King goes on to say that getting a chance to edit the 2007 edition of “The Best Ameri­can Short Stories” gave him an excuse to read a bunch of stories. It also, he says, inspired him to try to recapture the knack for writing stories that, along the way, had given way to the more expansive pursuit of writing novels. “Just After Sunset” suggests why. It’s an uneven collection, in both tone and execution, and it often reminds you of how King’s writing has moved beyond its genre roots. That’s not to affirm the critics who’ve reduced King’s writing to penny dreadfuls that have no bearing on the real world. Good writing of the fantastic and the macabre is always based in recognizable emotion. Noting the detail and empathy that have long made him one of the most observant chroniclers of American middle-class life, the critic Laura Miller shrewdly observed that King should accurately be judged “a realist.” In “Just After Sunset,” there are only flashes of the kind of recognition that King the novelist provides, and the short-story form does not allow him the space to turn his plot devices into metaphors. For me, that was most apparent in “N.” The tale has a tricky story-within-a-story structure. A woman whose psychiatrist brother has committed suicide forwards his notes to a boyhood friend who is now a television doctor. The notes tell of the shrink’s sessions with a patient who has come upon an odd patch of Maine woods where something evil and powerful lurks. The story showcases King’s almost unholy talent for making the natural world seem like something not of this world. But just when you’re ready for whatever is lurking in those woods to fully reveal itself and the power it wields, the story ends — granted, on an unsettling and clever note. But King seems to be just warming up, and the story feels like a sketch for one of his novel-length freakouts. Other stories range from the delirious bad taste of “The Cat From Hell” to the just plain bad taste of “A Very Tight Place,” from the gloppily inspirational “Ayana” to the botched brilliance of “The Things They Left Behind.” I have a special fondness for “The Cat From Hell.” Little furry creatures are often the victims in horror stories. King’s tale is revenge for every fictional house pet ever perfunctorily slaughtered in the name of thrills. It’s disgusting, and I mean that as a compliment. “The Things They Left Behind” proceeds to a tidy, too heartwarming ending. Imperfect though it is, it’s also the most affecting and scary story here. The narrator is an office worker who, in order to savor a late-summer day, called in sick on Sept. 11. About a year later, artifacts that belonged to his murdered co-workers begin turning up in his apartment. And that’s not all. At night, they begin whispering to each other, often in the voices of their dead owners. So much hand-wringing has already been expended over the question of how art should deal with 9/11. No fiction that has attempted the subject has, to my mind, been as effective (or as affecting) as King’s “From a Buick 8” and “Cell.” Both novels were direct and oblique, not mentioning 9/11 but addressing the question of how you retain your humanity after the unthinkable has entered your life. (In “Cell,” the characters’ reaction to the numbers 9-1-1 determines whether they remain human or become monsters.) There’s nothing oblique in “The Things They Left Behind.” King employs a simple, unnerving device to address the way the presence of the dead was palpable in the city following 9/11. Despite the disappointments of “Just After Sunset,” and the sense that these stories remain, at some level, an exercise, a stopgap for the next full-fledged King project, the book also feels like the work of a writer who, even in less than top form, wouldn’t dream of breaking faith with his readers.  Part of what I respect about Stephen King — and I suspect it’s part of what drives some of his fellow writers and some critics crazy — is the honesty of that admission, in this book’s introduction, that he churned out stories for money. There’s no pretense that he was “honing his craft” or “perfecting the form,” no attempt to disguise the fact that any writer who is honest enough admits to doing some time on Grub Street. Which is why, in books like “The Dark Half” and “The Shining,” King has been so witheringly accurate about the vanity and pettiness of writers. King’s critical reputation has by now had more corrections than the Dow. He has been both Horror Hack and Underrated Littérateur. Every few years, usually in the name of what Terry Southern called the “quality lit game,” somebody decides he’s taken too seriously and needs to be put back in the drugstore racks where they think he belongs. And any critical defense of King is usually good for a round of claims that said critic is decrying literature or assuming that book sales equal quality. So let’s be clear. King isn’t good because he’s popular. But any critic who puts King’s popularity down to the dreadful taste of the masses (cue Harold Bloom) has failed to do the basic work of a critic, which is to understand and probe and not simply to judge. King gets to readers because he renders everyday life so exactly and because he understands it is always ready to rupture. The literary critic Leslie Fiedler, in an interview given a few weeks before he died, recalled telling a group of postmodern fiction writers, “Look, let’s be frank with each other: When all of us are forgotten, people will still be remembering Stephen King.” Anyone who claims to be interested in contemporary American literature needs to understand what he’ll be remembered for.

25,Stephen King,2008-01-21,"By JANET MASLINJAN. 21, 2008 Stephen King’s “Duma Key” ventures to an all-but-uninhabited Florida island where the shells groan at high tide, tennis balls appear unexpectedly, foliage grows ominously quickly, and at least one heron flies upside-down. Given this combination of author and setting, it’s inevitable that something terribly undead will show up before the book is over. But Mr. King’s use of horror is not what it used to be. It may still be the impetus for his stories, but it is no longer the foremost reason they’re interesting. Sure, he can still use supernatural effects to scare the wits out of you. But lately he also shows off other interests. In the wake of the 1999 roadside accident that permanently altered his consciousness, he has turned the evanescence of health and sanity into his books’ most disturbing source of fear. “Duma Key” is about characters whose near-death experiences have given them psychic powers. That may make it sound fanciful, but this novel is frank and well grounded. Mr. King’s main character, Edgar Freemantle, is a regular Joe with only a few unusual qualities. One: He has struck it rich in the construction business. Another: He has lost an arm in an accident. And also this: Unlike may other people whose lives suddenly go off course, he knows exactly what hit him. It was a construction crane, and it smashed him to jelly. As the book begins, Edgar is in the process of moving from Minnesota to Florida. His doctor has ordered a change of scenery. So he arrives on Duma and moves into a big pink house with what is quite literally a drop-dead view of the sunset. “Salmon Point, No. 13,” says the young assistant who drives him to his new home, in a nice display of the author’s mischief. “I hope you’re not superstitious.” Mr. King takes his teasingly sweet time in revealing exactly what’s going on here. But it turns out that the sunsets make Edgar want to draw. And he’s good at it. And the details that crop up in his pictures have a way of prefiguring real events or even causing them, especially when those events are deadly. Elizabeth Eastlake, the ancient grande dame in the nearby house, has weirdly powerful artistic talents of her own. Like Elizabeth, and like Wireman, the affectionate ex-lawyer who takes care of her, Edgar lives in a befogged and unsteady mental state. Each of them has suffered some kind of head injury; each of them endures what Mr. King calls “weird slip-slides,” moments of maddening confusion. In such an atmosphere the rules of fantasy might run wild, but Mr. King constructs this story with patience and rigor. His own past tendency to wander untethered into the world of dreams is under control. So is his editors’ tendency to let that happen. The winding narrative of “Duma Key” is interspersed with short chapters on the subject of “How to Draw a Picture.” There are 12 of these, and they incorporate creeping, gradual revelations about Elizabeth’s fraught family history. (“You’re not going to tell me he raised six girls out here,” Edgar says to Wireman, upon hearing the tale of Elizabeth’s father. “That’s just too gothic.”) These chapters also offer direct advice about how the artist should treat memory, but they need not be high-minded. Mr. King more readily illustrates this, to the point where he doesn’t need to explain it. However simple his storytelling sounds, it exerts a relentless tidal pull. The expert scattering of secrets throughout this narrative helps to keep it moving. At first Mr. King takes an unhurried approach to introducing Edgar’s history (with two adult daughters, as well as an ex-wife who’d “taken off the Freemantle uniform and quit the team”) and Edgar’s amazement at the spookier aspects of Florida. But he picks up the pace when “Duma Key” reaches its puzzle stage. The last third of the book goes into overdrive, leading each of the people and objects strewn innocently through the story to some kind of diabolical turn. The graphic artist Mark Stutzman has delivered yet another great-looking cover that mimics Mr. King’s hidden-in-plain-sight tricks. Although this last part ought to be the book’s most furious, the less action-packed aspects of the story manage to be just as compelling. Mr. King generates suspense just following the way Edgar struggles with his memory. Likewise there is drama in the way he experiences phantom sensations of a lost arm, deals with his loved ones or tries to figure out what kind of Twilight Zone he’s wandered into. Then there are Edgar’s drawings, which evolve from innocent landscapes to the stuff of a full-fledged art career. Mr. King seems to have particular fun with the process by which Edgar finds himself becoming the toast of Sarasota and a lauded “American primitive” to boot. “Frogs the size of Cocker Spaniel puppies” are among the beastly things unleashed by Mr. King once the art appreciation stops — and the final melee begins. But his book has raised its ante in careful stages. So foreshadowing (“or so it seemed to me then”) gives way slowly to dark nuance. (“There’s something here, and it’s acting on me. Is it possible it even called me?”) Then comes terrible certainty. (“I felt it and knew: the three of us were here because something wanted us here.”) And then the menace is at the door. (“Horror waiting to happen. Inbound on rotted sails.”) And then it’s inside. And then there’s no reaching forward — for fear that “something cold and wet and draped in seaweed should reach back.” A version of this review appears in print on , on Page E1 of the New York edition with the headline: Darkness In the Land Of Steady Sunshine.

26,Stephen King,2008-03-02,"By JAMES CAMPBELLMARCH 2, 2008 When Stephen King accepted the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2003, he drew attention to the cultural divide “between the so-called popular fiction and the so-called literary fiction.” The award of the medal “to a guy like me” inspired the hope that “in the future things don’t have to be the way they’ve always been. Bridges can be built.” If Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley count as authors of so-called literary fiction, then King has been engaged in building bridges since that evening. The plot of “Duma Key,” ghastly in itself but certain to bring horrified pleasure to King’s enormous readership, could have been sketched on the reverse side of Wilde’s “Picture of Dorian Gray,” a grisly examination of the magic of art. Sinister sounds, possibly vampiric, are audible beneath the foundations of the house around which the story is set, while the narrator blunders into generating malevolent forces beyond his control. Edgar Freemantle is a former construction boss who has moved to Florida after losing his right arm in an on-site accident. He takes a psychologist’s advice and does “a geographical,” relocating to a solitary strip amid the “charm-bracelet of keys lying off the west coast of Florida,” where he begins to paint. There he settles into a house he refers to as Big Pink, establishes a friendship with his neighbors and beholds a natural splendor that cannot fail to inspire a recuperating patient with a new hobby. To Edgar’s surprise, everyone is knocked out by the pictures he produces. The local art critic pronounces him “a true American primitive.” The gallery owner assures him that it’s a compliment. As in much of his recent work, including “Dreamcatcher” and “From a Buick 8,” King draws in elements of the road accident he suffered in Maine in 1999, when an inattentive truck driver shattered his hip, ribs, spine and much else besides (in both his own and Freemantle’s story, a Dodge truck was involved). The first section of “Duma Key” concerns Edgar’s frustrating pain and memory loss, his dealings with therapists, the storm that comes over his domestic life. When he becomes violent, his wife seeks a divorce, leaving only an anger-management doll for company. Even she is apt to get it in her “stupid yielding body” when Edgar is stricken by a memory blackout. A steady scatological flow runs through “Duma Key”; even in better moments Edgar is given to remarks like “you can lead a whore to culture, but you can’t make her think.” The psychic theme kicks in early, with the artist’s realization that he has put a photographic likeness of his daughter’s fiancé into a painting, without ever having seen him. Later, conscious of his aesthetic powers, he uses them to heal his friend and neighbor on the Key, Wireman, another man with a damaged past. Wireman looks after the elderly Elizabeth Eastlake, the owner of Big Pink. Only she knows the truth behind the mysterious murmurings from below and the ghostly apparitions on the horizon. Readers who will happily suspend disbelief when entering the supernatural realm might find it harder to do the same when faced with the reception of Edgar’s paintings, once he is persuaded to exhibit at the Scoto Gallery. He is definitely a “so-called popular” painter: even passers-by are deeply affected. For those who can afford it, “Step 1 is you tell me how much you want for that one. ... Step 2 is I write the check.” For others, like the faithful gofer and driver Jack, the response is simpler: “Dude, these are awesome!” The difficulty of evoking the wonder of graphic art that cannot be viewed has confounded many writers before King. Fending off the acclaim that greets him, Edgar dismisses his paintings as “reheated Dalí,” but it’s hard to square that comparison with the descriptions of four recent works, “the ones I’d come to think of as my sunset-composites. To one I’d added a nautilus shell, to one a compact disc with the word Memorex printed across it (and the sun shining redly through the hole), to the third a dead seagull I’d found on the beach, only blown up to pterodactyl size. The last was of the shell-bed beneath Big Pink, done from a digital photograph.” The plotting of “Duma Key” is labyrinthine, if overextended, with psychically connected deaths and the appearance of zombies in the living room, but the characterization is flimsy. Edgar does not present himself as likable, and Wireman is as annoying as anyone else who dots his conversation with Spanish phrases and catchy lines from rock ’n’ roll songs, and who refers to himself in the third person. A great amount of emotional energy on his part, and eventually on that of Edgar and Jack, goes into the care of Elizabeth Eastlake, but the charm of this “Personage” for the reader remains obscure. After she dies at the beginning of Edgar’s fateful exhibition, leaving Wireman $80 million in assets, the latter makes a proposal: “Then what do you say? Let us marry our fortunes together.” Edgar cleverly wriggles out of it by replying: “Simon and Garfunkel, 1969. ... I can’t decide now.” In his Book Foundation acceptance speech, King chided those who “make a point of pride” of choosing not to read John Grisham, Clive Barker or Mary Higgins Clark: “What do you think? You get social or academic brownie points for deliberately staying out of touch with your own culture?” Leaving aside the discourtesy of suggesting that his listeners’ reading habits were directed by snobbery rather than taste, the remark posits a view of a culture based not on the best that is thought and said, but on the highest returns at the cash register. If the term “literary fiction” has any meaning, it surely refers to a writer’s attempt to reflect something of the complexity of our lives in the interaction of characters. Little of the macabre events in Edgar’s story, the initial accident apart, bears any relation to most people’s lived experience. A sizable portion is devoted to unscrambling Miss Eastlake’s cryptic messages, then tracking down and stifling the ghouls to which they point. Candlesticks and silver harpoons are found to be more effective than wooden stakes, and Edgar goes about his business in the vile pit with the commendable attitude that no zombie can expect to kill his daughter and get away with it. “Duma Key” is a buddy Western pitched as a horror story — which is not to hazard a judgment on its literary merit. To adapt Oscar Wilde’s remark in the preface to “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” there is no such thing as popular or literary fiction. “Books are well written or badly written. That is all.” DUMA KEY By Stephen King. 611 pp. Scribner. $28.

27,Stephen King,2006-10-23,"By JANET MASLINOCT. 23, 2006 This sentence is about to do the unthinkable: connect James Joyce and Stephen King. The comparison is not made for reasons of poetry, audacity or soul-searching: Mr. Joyce has a definite leg up in all those departments. But Mr. King has delivered his version of Joycean wordplay, idiosyncrasy, voluptuousness and stubborn, obsessive chronology in “Lisey’s Story.” Here is a tender, intimate book that makes an epic interior journey without covering much physical terrain. It can move great distances while traveling no further than from a house (home to lonely Lisey Landon, the widow of a Writer á la King) to its neighboring barn (the late writer’s “mostly benign one-boy clubhouse”). The scope sounds modest, yet this book is haunting even by Mr. King’s standards. And he knows a thing or two about haunting. This is no occasion to make great literary claims for Mr. King, or even to exalt his linguistic experimentation. His use of language in “Lisey’s Story” is so larded with baby talk that it borders on the pathological. Here is a writer who has a thousand ways of naming a toilet, and whose work can thus be an acquired taste. But “Lisey’s Story” transcends the toidy-talk to plumb thoughts of love, mortality and madness — and to deliver them with gale-force emotion. When Mr. King writes in a coda to this blunt but stunning book that “much here is heartfelt, very little is clever,” he is telling the truth. “Lisey’s Story” sounds like Mr. King’s most honest work — even more than “On Writing,” his candid, common-sense literary credo, or the first part of “Dreamcatcher,” which described a physical calamity very much like what he suffered (in 1999) after he was hit and nearly killed by a van. In “Lisey’s Story” he takes that near-death experience one step further and kills off Scott Landon, stellar novelist. Lisey’s public role as the great man’s wife is best summed up by a photo of Scott in which only half of Lisey’s loafer is visible on the side of the picture. Despite its title, and in keeping with Scott’s dominance in life, even Lisey’s so-called story is largely about him. He does not need to be physically present to make his mark. For Lisey, Scott lives “in her mind’s eye (where the past is always present).” And he lives in the pervasive, spooky sense that he has left her a legacy of hints, warnings and messages — not just in the real world but in a fantasy realm they have visited together. Scott is of course also present in his writing. And the residue of his career looms large in her life. The one commonplace, garden-variety part of “Lisey’s Story” is a subplot that has Lisey menaced by a sadistic creep. But this sadistic creep, unlike most, is interested in acquiring the unpublished letters and papers of a big-deal author. The greater part of “Lisey’s Story” is about Lisey and Scott’s long union. And Mr. King describes it in passionate yet wonderfully quotidian ways. “I come to you and you see me whole,” Scott told Lisey when he proposed marriage in 1979 — and the moment is as alive for her now as it was back then. “You love me all the way around the equator and not just for some story I wrote. When your door closes and the world’s outside, we’re eye to eye.” This book goes beyond those words to give a palpable sense of their enduring love affair. It was deeply romantic, but also very strange. It should surprise none of Mr. King’s readers that Scott Landon, beneath the popular and presentable surface, beyond “his forehead, behind which all the exotic storyfish swim,” was one weird dude. The mind that generated all those wild (and wildly salable) horror fantasies was full of anguish, and “Lisey’s Story” hooks its narrative momentum to the gradual revelation of what Scott’s torment was like. The book loves Lisey enough to believe that once she gets to the bottom of Scott’s psyche she will be free to live a life of her own. Now we get the “gonzo-bonkie” stuff (in one of Mr. King’s tamer locutions). Scott’s memories of his monstrous father have driven him to catatonia and worse. They will dredge up unspeakable memories before the book is over, and Lisey’s true capacity as a helpmate will be tested. In this marriage, more than just a secret language is shared; Scott’s pain is also something that belongs to both of them. She begins to enter into his private world of terrible memories, thoughts which reduced the living, adult Scott to talking like a terrified child. “Lisey’s Story” also has a warmly candid sense of Lisey’s dealings with her several sisters, one of whom is nearly 60 and begins, quite startlingly, to channel Scott’s vocabulary from beyond the grave. She also shares Scott’s way of staring blankly into the distance — “or into the mystic, if you were a Van Morrison fan,” Mr. King writes. When Lisey learns that Scott consulted a doctor to arrange for this sister’s medical care “she wondered at what point in the conversation the doctor had asked Scott where he got his ideas.” In the midst of its capacity to shock and ravish, “Lisey’s Story” also has keen, witty insight into the world of a writerly superstar. As Mr. King’s coda explains, “Lisey’s Story” is full of references to books, songs, poems and movies, all of which add up to the world that had meaning for Scott. Some of these allusions are more mischievous than others. Surely Lisey’s smoking Salem Lights has something to do with the way that “Salem’s Lot,” the second King novel and great early hit, rocked Stephen and Tabitha King’s world.

28,Stephen King,2014-06-08," By Megan Abbott Halfway through “Mr. Mercedes,” billed as Stephen King’s first hard-boiled detective novel, a fedora makes an appearance. It’s a winking gift to the retired cop hero, Bill Hodges, from his first client, Janey Patterson. “Every private dick should have a fedora he can pull down to one eyebrow,” she tells him. Hodges tries it on for size, as do Jerome (his teenage Watson) and even Janey herself. No one seems to hang on to it for long. Then, at a critical point in the story, it disappears in a flash. The fedora’s symbolic weight, and conspicuous disappearance, signal both King’s affectionate awareness of the hard-boiled tradition and his point of departure from it. The premise of “Mr. Mercedes” bears all the genre’s hallmarks. Battered and lonely, Hodges is the archetypal detective haunted by the big case he couldn’t crack — that of Mr. Mercedes, the mystery assailant who plowed a car through a crowd, killing eight people. Pressed into service by Janey, the sister of the woman whose car the killer used, he quickly feels energized and committed to his cause. The novel’s two wealthy sisters even seem to be a nod to Carmen and Vivian Sternwood, Raymond Chandler’s dangerous pair in “The Big Sleep.” At one point, Hodges wonders if he “could be Philip Marlowe after all,” envisioning a “va-voom receptionist” like someone out of a Mickey Spillane novel. King is clearly having fun, and so are we.  In the decades since Chandler and Spillane, the genre has expanded and evolved past the classic straight white male detective who upholds honor in a fallen world. Yet from Harry Bosch and Elvis Cole to the HBO series “True Detective,” the archetypal gumshoe continues to hold our gaze; we need him, it would seem. As Chandler wrote in his celebrated essay “The Simple Art of Murder,” setting the rules for decades of knight-errant detectives to come: “He is the hero, he is everything.” The world may change, but he remains our constant. King understands how this attachment works. In interviews, he often speaks about how popular horror novels reflect the cultural anxieties of their era — the deterioration of the traditional family, changing gender roles, economic decline. So it is with the detective tale, each new set of fears generating a new foe, a new threat. And King cannily focuses on a particularly urgent and timely one: the spree of rampage killers dominating current headlines. As opposed to mobsters or serial murderers, these assailants hit us where we live: a primary or secondary school, a college campus, a movie theater, a shopping mall, a beloved marathon. In “Mr. Mercedes,” it’s a job fair, a poignant sign of recessionary times. And as the story unfolds, the killer, baited by Hodges, plans a far more momentous public act of terrorism. For the first half of the novel, King tickles our anxieties, his detective engaging in a classic cat-and-mouse game with the killer. But you can feel him wriggling against the hard-boiled tradition, shaking the hinges. Soon enough, in ways large and small, he rejects and replaces the genre’s creakiest devices. Instead of another hard-drinking soulful detective, King presents a hero who lost interest in alcohol upon his retirement, and whose only addiction is daytime television. And while Marlowe (nearly always) abstains from women, and John D. MacDonald’s Travis McGee or Walter Mosley’s Easy Rawlins pursue them relentlessly, ­Hodges’ sexual interests are focused, monogamous and decidedly un-neurotic. But it’s the larger genre deviations that make “Mr. Mercedes” feel so fresh. At their purest, hard-boiled novels are fatalistic, offering a Manichaean view of humanity. For King, however, dark humor extends beyond the investigator’s standard one-­liners, reflecting a larger worldview. Killers and detectives make mistakes all the time (the wrong victim consumes the poisoned hamburger; the intended target fails to start his own car), and coincidences play a far greater role than fate. “Mr. Mercedes” is a universe both ruled by a playful, occasionally cruel god and populated by characters all of whom have their reasons. One man can do only so much. This brings us back to the fedora. Fundamental to classic hard-boiled fiction is the idea that one man, the detective, is our vanguard against evil. But King has something else in mind. Tossing that fedora back and forth among his characters — Hodges, his computer whiz assistant, Janey, all his “good guys” — he decides it fits them all but suits none. The one person it might suit never wears it: Janey’s 45-year-old cousin, Holly Gibney, who turns out to be King’s most important character. The fedora’s disappearance (by incineration) marks a shift in the story itself. Thereafter, Hodges begins to retreat, ceding the spotlight to Holly, a most unlikely hard-boiled hero. First described as a “spinster,” Holly still lives with her mother and barely speaks above a mutter. A smoker, a lip biter, a Lexapro popper, she’s an accumulation of nervous tics. At one point, watching her quiver, Hodges notes her knees “almost literally knocking.”  King is up to something sneaky. This is not the woman we find in old-school hard-boiled novels (or even the revisionist updates, which favor, as we’d hope, female competency, wile and grit). It’s as if Carmen Sternwood, the thumb-­sucking, ­seizure-ridden sister from “The Big Sleep,” were transformed from murderous kewpie to insistent ally. And as if the private investigator, instead of dismissing or isolating this unusual woman, has found a way to reckon with her humanity. King’s game plan pays off exuberantly in the last act, which defies expectations in ways both surprising and invigorating. You can practically hear King rubbing his hands together as Holly jostles herself into the center of the action, playing a critical role in the investigation but also, more substantially, providing the nerve, drive and jittery heart of the novel.  At the end of “Mr. Mercedes,” Holly is not about to hang up a shingle to become one of the genre’s “unlikely” detectives in the manner of the private eye with Tour­ette’s from Jonathan Lethem’s “Motherless Brooklyn.” What makes her unique is that heroic though she is, she is not driven by relentless and abstract ideals. Unlike Chandler’s “man of honor,” Holly is not motivated by a sense of mission or nobility. Her reasons are personal — including some long-nursed grudges that may bring “Carrie” to mind — and utterly idiosyncratic. They are, in other words, more like our own. In “The Simple Art of Murder,” Chandler wrote: “In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption.” He’s making the case for his Philip Marlowe, honorable and true, his “shopworn Galahad.” But nobility for nobility’s sake doesn’t interest King. In the end, with his characters facing the unbearable possibility of a second, far worse act of senseless violence, King locates his “quality of redemption” in a woman with “graying hair and the face of a neurotic teenager” — and in the makeshift family that has formed between Hodges, Jerome and Holly herself. No one man or woman, King suggests, can forestall every act of senseless violence or protect us from random catastrophe. But what “Mr. Mercedes” offers instead are bighearted men and women who are, after all, much like us. And, King seems to be reminding readers, the good guys still outnumber the bad.  MR.

DANSE MACABRE By Stephen King.  Illustrated. 400 pp. New York: Everest House. $13.95. FANS of Stephen King will not be surprised to learn that Mr. King is a fan himself, for he regularly lets his enthusiasms show through in his books, ''best-scarers'' such as '' 'Salem's Lot,'' ''The Dead Zone'' and recently ''Firestarter.'' He has now assembled a trick-ortreat bag of goodies - childhood reminiscences, anecdotes about fellow writers, plot synopses of favorite films, novels, stories and television programs, a selected reading list, even a quiz -that deals with the genre in which he has so far chosen to work. ''Danse Macabre,'' a one-man flea market of opinions and ideas, will certainly be a treat for those avid readers of horror, fantasy and science fiction who like nothing better than to sit around, after a George Romero double-feature followed by a late-night rerun of ''The Twilight Zone,'' and recall the great days of E.C. Comics.  However, for those who have little interest in accompanying Mr. King on a highly discursive ramble through byways lined with other people's monsters and mad scientists, this book may prove both boring and baffling, a trick instead of a treat. (On the other hand, since Mr. King is not only a fan but a proselytizer, some unsuspecting types may buy ''Danse Macabre,'' not noticing that it's nonfiction, and end up happily conversing about press runs at Arkham House.) Excess is Mr. King's stock-in-trade, and he has used his prodigious energies over the years to soak up vast quantities of material about weird literature and film. In a spirit of the utmost good humor and generosity, he now spews out all the thoughts he's been storing up, sharing his crotchets and promoting his pets. Mr. King, who possesses an enviable superabundance of imagination, suffers from a less enviable logorrhea. Along with hundreds of names, relevant and irrelevant - from Shirley Jackson to Joan Didion, from H.P.  Lovecraft to Ronald McDonald - we are exposed to thousands of Kingian pronouncements; there is nothing that doesn't elicit an opinion from him - or a definitive statement. As he admits, he cannot resist ''following any trace of interesting scent.'' He digresses with glee, never reins in his garrulity and always says what he is thinking - a veritable fetishist of his own synaptic responses. It's one thing to learn what were the books and movies of Mr. King's youth, another to be told what year he was toilet-trained (1950). But perhaps one ought to overlook this self-indulgence, a flaw by almost any standards, since the flood of his prose is swept along by so much warm affection for a sort of writing that, outside a narrow circle, is often underappreciated. And after all, he disarmingly tells us, even his grandfather once despaired, ''When you open your mouth, Stevie, all your guts fall out.'' Mr. King approaches the various notions he explores as if he were handling a midway bumper car: He drives up to a concept and bangs it from all directions, particularly those beliefs that he holds most fervently: ''Story must be paramount over all other considerations in fiction'' and ''The horror story is in many ways an optimistic, upbeat experience.'' ''Danse Macabre'' ranges widely over the past 30 years, even pausing to touch on what Mr. King considers the ''bedrock of horror fiction ... you gotta scare the audience.'' A clearly stated dictum, which only Mr. King would deem it necessary to elaborate on immediately: ''Sooner or later you gotta put on the gruesome mask and go booga-booga.'' Mr. King's class-clown mannerisms - his fascination with nose picking and clogged pores, his fondness for words such as puke, yuch and dreck - are partly a defense mechanism, I believe. He has serious thoughts and ambitions and wants to be taken seriously; at the same time, he's a little bit jumpy about it. There is a vulnerable ''kid inside'' him who can still weep over the look on King Kong's face as he clings to the Empire State Building.  I grew up at exactly the same time as Mr. King, and our touchstones for that period are identical: ''Search for Bridey Murphy,'' ''The Three Faces of Eve,'' ''Riders to the Stars,'' ''Creature from the Black Lagoon,'' William Castle and Roger Corman, Barbara Steele and Vincent Price. Like Mr. King, I remember worrying about the three lives of Herbert Philbrick, the challenge posed by Sputnik I, and ''the spectre of juvenile delinquency.'' (Even ''the one-eyed, onehorned flying purple people eater'' seemed fairly ominous to me.) There's a lot of sociology interwoven among the trivia about comic books like Tales From the Crypt and movies like ''The Thing,'' not the least of which is what it was like to grow up in the 1950's and come of age in the 60's. Anyone susceptible to the lure of good or bad ''fright artistry'' will acknowledge all the contradictions inherent in explications of it. We hear from Mr. King that the horror genre ''deliberately appeals to all that is worst in us,'' yet is also nutritive, ''salt for the mind.'' It can ''be reactionary, anarchistic, and revolutionary all at the same time.'' Moreover, Mr. King proposes ''that only people who have worked in the field for some time truly understand how fragile this stuff really is, and what an amazing commitment it imposes on the reader or viewer of intellect and maturity.'' Kids, on the other hand, get it right off the bat, lifting ''the weight of unbelief with ease.'' ''Here is the final truth of horror movies,'' Mr. King suggests with characteristic optimism. ''They do not love death, as some have suggested; they love life. They do not celebrate deformity but by dwelling on deformity, they sing of health and energy. By showing us the miseries of the damned, they help us to rediscover the smaller (but never petty) joys of our own lives. They are the barber's leeches of the psyche, drawing not bad blood but anxiety ... for a little while, anyway.'' Not all moviegoers or readers enjoy being scared, and some believe ''that an interest in horror is unhealthy and aberrant,'' a tenet Mr. King struggles mightily to refute. He succeeds, although by the end of ''Danse Macabre'' he's reeling groggily from the effort. But then, despite my reservations about his stylistic predilections and my cavils about his tastelessness, I was on his side from the very start. Many of us are drawn to the horror story, as Pandora to the box or Jonathan Harker to the forbidden rooms in Castle Dracula, though we are protected by the safety net of fictional distance. Mr. King simply wants to remind us of what Joseph Conrad once wrote in ''Lord Jim'': ''As long as there is any life before one, a jolly good fright now and then is a salutary discipline.'' Michele Slung has edited two anthologies of suspense stories, ''Crime on Her Mind'' and ''Women's Wiles.''

By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt CUJO. By Stephen King. 319 pages. Viking.  $13.95. EVERYTHING begins so simply in Stephen King's latest novel, ''Cujo,'' perhaps the cruelest, most disturbing tale of horror he's written yet. One day this 200-pound St. Bernard named Cujo is chasing a rabbit in back of his owner's house, which happens to lie at the end of a dead-end road outside a small town in Maine. Cujo is a good and gentle animal, but what dog can resist a rabbit racing by? So Cujo chases the rabbit into a hole in the side of a meadow, which turns out to be the entrance to a small limestone cave full of rabid bats. When Cujo tries to follow the rabbit into the hole, he gets bitten by one of the rabid bats. Pretty soon, Cujo isn't feeling so good. Pretty soon, Cujo is mad. But things get complicated fast in Mr. King's imagination. Things get awful. Before you know it, we have the following situation. The members of the family that own Cujo are away or otherwise indisposed. A mother and her 4-year-old boy, Donna and Tad Trenton, are trapped in a Ford Pinto that is stuck in the driveway of Cujo's house. The weather is stiflingly hot. The Pinto's battery is dead. Nobody knows that Donna and her boy are there. Except Cujo. ''And a moment later Cujo's foam-covered, twisted face popped up outside her window, only inches away, like a horror movie monster that has decided to give the audience the ultimate thrill by coming right out of the screen. She could see his huge, heavy teeth,'' Mr.  King writes. ''Those red, bleary eyes stared into hers. The dog's muzzle looked as if it had been badly lathered with shaving cream that had been left to dry. Cujo was grinning at her.'' Manipulated Terror Now, normally I hate this sort of exercise in terror: the feeling of claustrophobia and helplessness; the exhausting knowledge that there are hundreds of pages to go, and the victims will not escape until nearly the last one; the sense of dependency on the author's manipulations - instead of stimulating, I find these wearisome and depressing. But Mr. King, whose more recent novels are ''The Stand,'' ''The Dead Zone'' and ''Firestarter,'' has thrown something extra into the usual mixture. For one thing, he does it all so skillfully, bringing his Maine locale to life with pungent bucolic language and fleshing out his characters far beyond the apparent requirements of his story.  For another thing, he throws in certain plot perversities. Near the start of the book, for example, there's a switch of scene to Iowa City, where a little girl suddenly appears to be vomiting vast amounts of blood. Back in Maine, there's a fellow Donna took briefly as a lover, who isn't reacting altogether sanely to her decision to end the affair. In the closet of Tad's room, there's a monster who may not be entirely imaginary and who seems to have some connection with Frank Dodd, the psychopathic killer-policeman who erupted in Mr. King's earlier ''The Dead Zone.'' Donna recalls that Cujo was also the name of one of the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. And she has this feeling that Cujo the dog knows something. Not the Usual Rules The upshot of all this is that you begin after a while to get this uneasy, ugly feeling that Mr. King is trying to do more than harmlessly thrill you. He's not playing by the usual rules. The cavalry may not arrive in time. The boy may be snatched by the Erlkonig. In the end, I don't really know what Mr. King is trying to say. It may be that there are simply dark places in the world from which blind evil emanates - the hole in the side of the meadow where the rabid bats are sleeping, the darkness in Tad's closet from which the musty smell is coming. Surely, Donna isn't being punished for her marital transgression; after all, she understands it, ends it and purges herself of it as effectively as anyone has done in recent fiction. Or maybe there's nothing more to the problem of evil in ''Cujo'' than what Mr. King says about his writing: ''I like to scare people, and people like to be scared. That's what I'm there to do. I like to go for the jugular.'' He certainly hits the jugular with ''Cujo.'' But it's a nasty book that leaves you feeling uneasy as well as afraid. It also leaves you with the feeling that none of its evil has been purged.

By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt DIFFERENT SEASONS. By Stephen King.  527 pages. Viking. $16.95. THERE'S a somewhat contrived explanation for the title of Stephen King's latest work of fiction, ''Different Seasons.'' The subtitles of its four long stories, or novellas, are ''Hope Springs Eternal,'' ''Summer of Corruption,'' ''Fall from Innocence'' and ''A Winter's Tale.'' Different seasons, get it? Also, Mr. King is trying to warn the reader that the book is a departure from his usual work, which up until now has been eight full-length novels of horror. Not only are the stories in ''Different Seasons'' shorter, they are also not exclusively concerned with making the reader's flesh crawl. Indeed the first story, ''Hope Springs Eternal: Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,'' is a clever and triumphant account of a prison escape. And the third story, ''Fall From Innocence: the Body,'' is, among a number of other things, a memoir about becoming a writer. ''Different Seasons'' is also apt as a title because it suggests a variety of spices - different seasonings, as it were. Nonetheless, had the decision been mine to make, I would have been inclined to call the collection ''Rites of Passage.'' This is no clumsier a play on words than the present title, for all four stories concern the progress from one place to another, whether it is from inside prison to outside, or from the womb to the world, or from youth to maturity, or from life to death. More specifically, three of the four stories are more or less built around the situation of literally having to pass through a tube of one sort or another. In the first story, a man has to make his way through a sewerage system. The last story, ''A Winter's Tale: the Breathing Method,'' is about one of the most difficult births ever recorded or even imagined. And in the long memoir ''The Body,'' the narrator compares a moment of extreme terror with the experience he once had of getting trapped for a minute or two while trying to crawl through a culvert. In fact, a case could be made that the least satisfying story in the book, ''Summer of Corruption: Apt Pupil,'' an extremely slick but somewhat hokey tale about the secret relationship of an all-American boy and a Nazi, is weak precisely because it lacks that terrifying image of getting caught in a tight passage. Or it lacks any sort of play on our unconscious fears, the pervasiveness of which in his fiction accounts I think for its great popularity. Mr. King may not be one to spin out delicate prose, but he surely knows what bothers people. There's also a less literal sense here, in which Mr. King seems concerned about being trapped or stuck. An insistent theme of the long memoir-story ''The Body'' - about four boys on a sort of pilgrimage to view a corpse - is the frustration of not having one's words understood, of making ''revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it.''  This complaint can be seen, of course, as the plight of any writer -or any writer struggling to scale the power of his art to the strength of his feelings. But because of the context in which the narrator of ''The Body'' expresses this frustration - it happens to come out at a moment in which the memoirist finds himself alone at sunrise with a grazing deer, and wishes he could find words that wouldn't diminish the feeling of peace he gets from the experience - one can't help suspecting that the author's sense of entrapment involves at least in part his being a writer of horror stories. This suspicion is reinforced by Mr. King's somewhat self-conscious Afterword, in which he explains how the stories in ''Different Seasons'' came to be written, and betrays considerable ambivalence over being ''typed'' as a horror writer. In a sense, then, the very act of writing these stories is a rite of passage from a tight place. To a degree, Mr. King has been successful at achieving this escape. The first and third stories - that is, the prison escape and the memoir - depend on conventions of horror, yet also transcend them by a considerable margin. But only the future will tell how completely Mr. King can escape the genre, or even whether he really wants to.  Right now, it seems, he is working on a novel about a haunted car.  This sounds unpromising and will no doubt turn out to be terrifying. Meanwhile, one certain fact is re-established by these four stories, especially the final one, in which a combination of the cliche and the absurd is somehow parlayed into a remarkable chiller.  At the ungentle art of plucking on our nerves to gain our undivided attention, Stephen King remains a master. We never escape the threat that the protagonist of ''The Breathing Method'' feels - that a door is going to blow open and reveal ''an insane Clark Ashton Smith landscape where the bitter shapes of twisted trees'' stand ''silhouetted on a sterile horizon below which double suns'' are ''setting in a gruesome red glare.'' Clumsy Mr. King's prose may be, yet it never fails to remind us of our nightmares.

DIFFERENT SEASONS By Stephen King.  527 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $16.95. ''THE most important things lie close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think.  When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.'' Thus speaks Gordie Lachance, millionaire horror-writer and narrator of ''The Body,'' one of four short novels bound together within the covers of ''Different Seasons,'' horror-writer Stephen King's ninth work of fiction. Over the last decade Mr. King has certainly not wanted for ears; he is one of the most popular writers of our era.  But unlike other vulgar - in the root sense of speaking in the voice of and to the average person - best-selling authors, Mr. King seems to have remained unsatisfied by mere popularity. As the speech of his fictional counterpart seems to suggest, the author of some of the best horror stories since those of Ambrose Bierce and H.P. Lovecraft may want more than acceptance. And it's precisely this quest for understanding, the drive to make his vision not only well known but deeply felt, that appears to have led him to publish this uneven, though often surprising, volume. The first surprise comes early: The opening prison narrative titled ''Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'' shows us that the creator of such studies of the criminal mind as ''The Shining'' and ''The Dead Zone'' can effectively treat innocence as well as guilt.  Set in a fictional state penitentiary in the author's home state of Maine, the tale is told in the first person by Red, a prisoner and entrepreneur who has as one of his best customers a former banker and convicted murderer, Andy Dufresne. Dufresne stands out among the lifers in the yard long before Red discovers his real story; the man is a cultivated type who, even as he's fighting off the brutal sexual advances of Shawshank's population of ''sisters,'' apparently spends his time alone shaping and polishing pieces of quartz from the yard. This dedication to an art form of sorts impresses Red, who thought he had seen it all: ''First the chipping and shaping, and then the almost endless polishing and finishing with those rock-blankets. Looking at them (a pair of cuff links Dufresne has given him in exchange for a favor), I felt the warmth that any man or woman feels when he or she is looking at something pretty, something that has been worked and made - that's the thing that really separates us from the animals, I think - and I felt something else, too. A sense of awe for the man's brute persistence.'' It's difficult to imagine any reader feeling a sense of awe at the way Mr. King bullies his way through this tough-guy novella about Dufresne's struggle to establish his innocence and free himself by any means possible, but the piece does give off a certain warmth.  And if it's not ''pretty,'' it is still an admirable departure from the genre that made the author famous.  ''Apt Pupil,'' the second and longest narrative in the volume, also stands as the most disappointing. It is a psychological study of the tandem corruption of Todd Bowden, a Southern California high-school student, and Kurt Dussander, the Nazi war criminal he discovers in his own hometown. The story links the sunny present of America with the nightmare past of death camps and all of what Todd calls their ''gooshy'' atrocities. Big theme here - but in execution the piece comes off as somewhat silly, with the tone wavering between that of cartoon images from horror comic books and the worst variety of ulp fiction: ''He tasted life on his tongue like a draught of wine straight from the bottle.'' When Dussander cremates his cat in the kitchen oven, the novella begins to reek of more than baking feline flesh. And later, when each of this unlikely pair begins a series of murders, the stench may prove overpowering. But if Mr. King stumbles in ''Apt Pupil,'' he picks himself up again and continues at a fast clip with ''The Body,'' which is narrated by his doppelganger, Gordie Lachance. In this supposed memoir we return to the scene of a number of crimes from Mr. King's earlier fiction - Castle Rock, Me., the setting of ''The Dead Zone'' and ''Cujo'' - but the style here is once again in the psychological rather than the supernatural mode. Narrator Lachance takes us back to the initiation rite that may have formed him as a successful writer - the overnight trek into the Maine woods he took with three other working-class friends in search of another teen-ager's rotting corpse. He sees the story as one of those revelations that exact a high price emotionally but help a writer to understand his past and ''get ready for some future mortality.'' There's some pretentiousness to Lachance's tale, especially in the inclusion of two stories that he published in little magazines early in his career, some swipes at writers such as John Gardner (who, ironically, professes to be one of Mr. King's greatest fans), praise of Ralph Ellison, and some Mailerlike conceit (''And although no one is ever going to call me the Thomas Wolfe of my generation, I rarely feel like a cheat.  ...''). But there's a lot to admire in this recollection of dead and dead-end kids - and a scene in which the boys attempt to cross a railroad trestle as the tracks begin to hum may induce a permanent fear of hiking. Readers who fear that Mr. King may have hiked permanently out of the territory in which they love to see him travel will be reassured to learn that in ''The Breathing Method,'' the final novella in this collection, he returns to the horror story as a conquering hero.  Tipping his hat to, among others, Jorge Luis Borges and Peter Straub, he invents a New York City men's club whose members gather for an annual pre-Christmas terror-telling session. Here other voices whisper in other rooms, and a genteel physician turns something as contemporary as the Lamaze Method into a vehicle for a frightening fiction about old New York. The natural narrative force that previously has helped Mr. King overcome his often clumsy prose and sophomoric philosophizing churns through these pages stronger than ever before; and yet he's never written anything that seems so polished and finished. As a collection ''Different Seasons'' is flawed and out of balance, but that shouldn't deter anyone with a taste for interesting popular fiction. Each of the first three novellas has its hypnotic moments, and the last one is a horrifying little gem. Alan Cheuse is the author of ''The Bohemians,'' a novel, and ''Candace & Other Stories.''

CHRISTINE By Stephen King.  526 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $16.95. SEVERAL years ago Stephen King published ''Night Shift,'' a collection of short stories that had appeared in magazines before his debut as a novelist. Among them was ''Trucks,'' in which the products of Detroit's auto industry were anthropomorphized and portrayed as barbaric, homicidal and utterly antihuman. I recall the piece vividly, because Mr. King made those vehicles - all vehicles - live not only on the page but in my imagination. ''Trucks'' might also have been the inspiration for Mr. King's latest novel. ''Christine'' appears to be formed along the classic lines of a triangle. There is Arnie Cunningham, the bookish, bullied, introverted high school student. His best friend is Dennis Guilder, even though Dennis is the all-American Arnie never could be. Then there is the beautiful Leigh Cabot who meets Arnie first and plays the princess to his frog, although by all rights she should be Dennis's girl. Besides being the timid soul who won the lady, Arnie is also an auto mechanic, a master craftsman in the true sense of the word. And like any artisan of merit, he cherishes that which he works on, in this case a 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine. Christine belonged to Roland LeBay, a malcontent who was involved in an accident in which both his wife and child perished. Nonetheless LeBay has held on to the car for two decades. But, too old to pass the driver's eye examination now, he puts Christine up for sale. For reasons Dennis can't understand, Arnie squanders his summer earnings to buy this hulk whose crankshaft barely turns over. Arnie declares that he will restore Christine to her original beauty. Through her (never it) he will show his parents just what he can do on his own, show everyone what a ''loser'' is capable of. In Stephen King's world, however, things are not so simple. Writing in a clear, precise style that recalls ''The Shining'' and ''Firestarter,'' the author gently leads the reader from the believable to the incredible. Like the movie director Steven Spielberg, Mr. King is a master of infusing life into inanimate objects or nonhuman forms.  When Christine begins to repair herself, and certainly when we ride with her on her first murderous adventure, we cannot doubt that she is as alive as any of the other characters. Such humanity becomes painfully clear toward the conclusion of the novel. Leigh loves Arnie, but such emotion is inadequate to wrest him away from Christine's spell. Christine, on the other hand, has become deathly jealous of Leigh and contrives a way to push Leigh into a compromising situation with Dennis. When Arnie sees his girl in the arms of his best friend, the tragedy is complete. Christine's demonic fury becomes his own, and the traitors become its object. But will Arnie succeed?  In this novel Mr. King proves once again that there is no substitute for the art of storytelling. His narrative carries such momentum that the reader must force himself to slow down in spite of the desire to turn to the next page and the next one. Much of the story's appeal derives from Mr. King's use of the American teenager's love affair with the automobile. (The lyrics that preface each chapter - by performers like Chuck Berry, Bruce Springsteen, Janis Joplin and the Beach Boys - reflect this popular obsession.) If George Romero, to whom the book is in part dedicated, had made ''American Graffiti,'' ''Christine'' could well have been the result. Coupled with this is the familiarity of the high school milieu in which the tale is set. Since most of us have been in similar situations, we can identify with the characters and their environment. Mr. King plunges the reader straight into his characters' lives. Through exposure to their day-by-day existence we learn exactly what it is that makes them tick: the vanities, the moral backsliding, the selfaggrandizements, the small fears that blossom into paranoia. Then very slowly the sum of these attributes begins to produce the weaknesses that breathe reality into the work. Such intimacy permits us to trust the author. So when things begin to appear slightly out of focus, when familiar terrain takes on new contours and the natural becomes supernatural, we are drawn in along with the characters. Some readers, particularly those who aren't raising teen-agers, might find Mr. King's use of the vernacular tiresome or even objectionable. The same is true of his penchant for employing manufacturers' labels on everyday appliances and higlighting the influence of popular rock songs on his characters' lives. But these are comments on style, not substance. At its best, reading ''Christine'' is not unlike watching trapeze artists at the precise instant when they suspend themselves between swings in midair. Time is frozen; for an instant everything is breathtaking, awesome. There are many such moments in ''Christine,'' for it is vintage King. Phillipe Van Rjndt's latest novel is ""Samaritan.""

By Stephen King. 526 pages.  Viking. $16.95. A POSSESSED car? An insanely angry 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine that drives itself around attacking people? This time Stephen King has gone too far, I said to myself as I began to catch the drift of his eighth and latest horror novel, ''Christine.'' This time he's not going to get me the way he did in ''The Shining,'' ''The Stand,'' ''Cujo'' and his other maniacal stories. This time he's just going to leave me cold. For a while, I was right. Never before has Mr. King seemed to labor so hard to get his story cranked up. Never has he had to wheel such elaborate plot machinery on stage - beginning with the moment when Arnie Cunningham, the pimply faced 15-year-old sidekick of the novel's narrator, Dennis Guilder, falls in love with an old junk heap because, as Arnie explains to Dennis: ''There's something underneath. Something else. Something better. I see it, that's all.'' Never before have Mr. King's effects seemed quite so creaky. ''The smell - a rotten thick smell under the aromas of new seat covers and the cleaning fluid he had used on the floormats. It was there, faint but terribly unpleasant. Almost stomach-turning. As if, at some time, something had crawled into the car and died there.'' Never has Mr. King's dialogue seemed so phony and manipulative. ''I think that part of being a parent is trying to kill your kids,'' says Arnie at a moment when he's patently the author's mouthpiece.  ''Because as soon as you have a kid, you know for sure that you're gong to die. When you have a kid, you see your own gravestone.'' ''I think that's gruesome,'' says Dennis Guilder, and they both burst out laughing. ''I don't mean it that way,'' concludes Arnie.  And yet, Mr. King eventually gets to you with his snarling, murderous monster on wheels. Not that ''Christine'' ever achieves the sustained terror of the author's best previous work. But there's an impressively ominous quality to the scenes in which the beast prepares to attack. The scream of her engine, the squeal of her tires, her baleful headlights blazing out of the dark - you get to believing a little that Christine is alive. There's a quite terrific scene in which three teen-age hoodlums who have trashed Christine in an earlier episode are out cruising and boozing on a lonely stretch of highway, and suddenly, ''Behind them, distant, perhaps as much as three miles back, headlights twinkled like insignificant yellow sparks in the night.'' It has to be Christine, on the rampage again. And the way Christine eliminates the evidence of her nighttime forays: if I had to explain, it would seem ridiculous. And yet it's eerily impressive the way Mr. King describes it.  How has he succeeded in sucking us in once again? Partly it's the very pushiness of his technique. The more he exasperates us by overpreparing, the more effectively his preparations eventually pay off. In the long run, we not only find ourselves emotionally involved with Arnie Cunningham and his hellish heap, but we also end up rooting at times for the sick pair to succeed. Another reason for the plot's surprising success is the extent to which Mr. King has immersed his novel in a 1950's adolescent culture that depended on cars. Christine herself is ''A dinosaur from the dark ditty-bop days of the 50's when,'' he continues, ''Carl Perkins was singing about pink pedal pushers and Johnny Horton was singing about dancing all night on a honkytonk hardwood floor and the biggest teen idol in the country was Edd (Kookie) Byrnes.'' Each of the novel's 51 chapters is introduced with a few lines from songs about cars, most of them vintage rock-and-roll hits from the 50's. The setting of the story is a suburb of Pittsburgh that came into its own as a result of the postwar car culture. In short, the very atmosphere of the book evokes memories of chopped hot-rods roaring into the parking lots of late-night pizza joints, their radios blasting Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and the Big Bopper. From here it is not such a leap to Christine, with ''her grille shaking like an open mouth full of chrome teeth, her headlights glaring.'' And as an added fillip, there's the memory of the author's previous novel, ''Cujo.'' There Mr. King killed off a young boy who didn't need or deserve to die. At the time I read ''Cujo,'' I thought this death represented some sort of darkening of Mr. King's vision, some new streak of pessimism over the chances of goodness to prevail in the battle against evil. Now, as a result of the nervousness I felt throughout the last third of ''Christine,'' I suspect that the boy's death was nothing philosophical. Mr. King was just showing us his willingness to knock off an innocent protagonist, just in case we were getting complacent about anyone's right to survive in his stories. Like a good poker player, he was setting us up for the next time. ''Christine'' is the next time, and in it Mr. King's tactics eventually pay off.

By Stephen King. 373 pages. Doubleday. $15.95. SOMEWHERE, around the time in 1980 when his novel ''Firestarter'' was published, it was written (I think), or said, that Stephen King was at work on a book that was frightening even to him. This was a fairly intriguing rumor, because since 1974, when his first novel, ''Carrie,'' came out, this prolific genius of horror had produced some fairly scary books, among the best of which were ''The Shining'' (1977) and ''The Stand'' (1978). But then, after that rumor got around, there came a number of books that were unlikely to have fit its description. It could not have been ''Cujo'' (1981), which was effective enough in its account of a killer dog on the loose, but hardly nightmare material. Nor could it have been ''Different Seasons'' (1982), an uneven collection of novellas, or ''Christine'' (1983), the rather slow-moving story of a homicidal car with a couple of frightening moments here and there. And it certainly wasn't going to be his latest book, ''Pet Sematary,'' with its downright silly title, inspired by a place on the edge of a Maine forest where children had gone over the years to bury their dead dogs and parakeets. Actually, there are a number of things that at first seem silly and innocuous about Mr. King's latest thriller. Along with the name of the book, there are the titles assigned to its three parts, ''The Pet Sematary,'' ''The Micmac Burying Ground'' and ''Oz the Gweat and Tewwible.'' There are all the portentous epigraphs about famous burials and Jesus's raising of Lazarus. And there's the first visit to the ''sematary,'' shortly after Dr. Louis and Rachel Creed and their two children, Ellie (5 years old) and Gage (a year old), arrive in Ludlow, Me. It is out in the woods in back of the colonial house they have just driven all the way from Chicago to settle into. It has little grave markers with messages on them, such as ''Smucky the Cat. He Was Obediant'' and ''Biffer, Biffer, a helluva sniffer/ until he died he made us richer.'' Who in creation does Mr. King think he's scaring with this claptrap? But it is simply amazing how quickly the mood proceeds to thicken. There is the authenticity of the story's Down East characters, particularly nice old Jud Crandall, who lives across the road from the Creeds and shows them the ''sematary.'' (This road should be called a highway really, because huge Orinco oil rigs come barreling along it every so often.) There is the author's sweetly folksy evocation of the Maine countryside (''and now there was goldenrod, that late-summer gossip which comes to tattle on autumn every year'') and, by way of contrast, the piling up on the page of brand-name products - Glad bags and Hefty bags, Cocoa Bears and Cokes, Schwinns and Liquiprins - annoying at times but useful to Mr. King in establishing the unstable quality of his domestic settings. There is Ellie's beloved cat, Winston Churchill, or Church, which seems to be killed one day by a speeding oil rig, but then comes back, ''like the cat in the nursery rhyme.''  And then Mr. King does something unspeakably cruel and heartbreaking, something that he has been toying with for a couple of books now, something bad enough so that he does not in the least appear to be straining for effect when he writes, by way of introducing what is going to happen next in ''Pet Sematary,'' ''It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.'' But never mind the horror, which, when the last drop of blood finally spills, does not seem much worse than the experience of reading a 373- page version of W. W. Jacobs's famous short story, ''The Monkey's Paw,'' which Mr. King honorably invokes a couple of times in the unlikely event that we have forgotten, or never knew, about the old couple who wish on a talisman that their son, recently mangled in a factory accident, would come back from the dead. What has always made Mr. King so effective as a storyteller is his instinct for subtly exploiting the unconscious hostility and consequent guilt that men and women feel in the routine of living with each other and raising their children. And what works particularly well for him in this latest of his fictional nightmares is the way old Jud Crandall seems to be offering relief to Louis Creed. Jud is like a drug - bad for you in the long run, but it feels so good right now. Well, you can always get rid of it tomorrow. And then it's just a little bit too late. So ''Pet Sematary'' seems, after all, the book that scared even its creator. And, sure enough, the dust jacket copy confirms it, announcing that Stephen King found his story ''so horrifying that he was for a time unwilling to finish writing it.'' One can sympathize with his feelings, but one also has to suspect he ran into a technical problem - that is, how to sustain the terror of the story without switching its point of view. This problem he does not solve: in his final chapters, the narrator of ''Pet Sematary'' resorts to the trick of scene changes to keep the horror flowing. Yet the illusion of ''Pet Sematary'' is never seriously dispelled. Once again, as I edged myself nervously toward the climax of one of his thrillers, I found myself considering what wonders Stephen King could accomplish if he would only put his storytelling talents to serious use. And then I had to ask myself: if Mr. King's aim in writing ''Pet Sematary'' was not entirely serious by some standard that I was vaguely invoking, then why, somebody please tell me, was I holding on to his book so hard that my knuckles had begun to turn white?

SKELETON CREW By Stephen King. 512 pp. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $18.95. STEPHEN KING'S fiction, at its best, is equivalent to the post-Expressionist art found in the tiny galleries of Manhattan's East Village, where painters, sculptors and collagists often turn to the aggressive headlines of tabloid newspapers for inspiration. What erupts in their work is an apocalyptic world, at once magnetic and repulsive, in which good howls at evil, nature runs headlong into technology, humor provides life's one grand escape and ''control'' is a word with little meaning. At its worst, Mr. King's writing resembles generic campfire stories. ''Skeleton Crew,'' a fat collection of short fiction and two forgettable poems, as indiscriminate in its assemblage as its author can be with words, shows off Mr. King's virtues and failings. He makes mistakes, sentences such as this one: ''There was a bit of pain, but not much; losing her maidenhead had been worse.'' He pokes fun at himself, by confessing to ''literary elephantiasis'' and saying, in his introduction, that he writes ''like fat ladies diet.'' But unfortunate images and bloat aside, Mr. King is a real talent: his scary tales are fun to read and, I would argue, accurate gauges of our deepest nightmares. The book's opener, ''The Mist,'' a story so long that less prolific souls might call it a novel, proves you can't fool Mother Nature. When the Army pursues an ominous top-secret project, all hell literally breaks loose. Mr. King escalates our worst anxieties into a hyperbolic fairy tale. In his world, the evil creatures that attack the classic sleepy village, the deaths of loved ones and the tests that the narrator-prince undergoes do not dissolve into a last, happy-ever-after sunset. The story is, however, written in typically cinematic King style; the first sentence starts a reader's internal movie projector humming. In the 11 years since he published ''Carrie,'' Stephen King's reliance on the symbols of popular culture - not just movies, but rock-and-roll, advertising jingles, hot cars - has become legendary and spoofable, perhaps because he understands these symbols better than some more upscale writers who likewise sprinkle their stories with brand names. His uncensored and uncensoring subconscious allows him to absorb the world around him and in him, and to spit it out almost undigested, as if he were walking around in a constant hypnagogic state. This condition is in some ways (or at least to some people) enviable. He conjures up the forgotten artifacts of childhood - talismans such as the fortune-telling Magic Eight-Ball - more easily than someone 10 years on the couch. And how many of us could bear living with such a rampant imagination? Mr. King provides a clue to what it might be like in his slightly ingenuous ''Notes'' section. He is telling how he came to write ''Survivor Type,'' a silly but effective story from the gross-me-out school of literature. (A doctor, stranded on an island after a shipwreck, progressively amputates parts of his body and eats himself. After he dines on his left foot, he writes in his journal, ''I kept telling myself: Cold roast beef. Cold roast beef. Cold roast beef.'') Anyway, Mr. King explains: ''I got to thinking about cannibalism one day . . . and my muse once more evacuated its magic bowels on my head. I know how gross that sounds, but it's the best metaphor I know.'' Freud would have gone crazy - and so would Mr. King's readers, if he did not distance himself from his material through humor, self-awareness and irony. Take, for instance, ''The Raft,'' a wonderfully gruesome story about four innocent kids marooned in the middle of a lake by a human-eating water slick that looks like ''dark, lithe Naugahyde.'' One of the boys, so terrified that he punches himself in the nose to feel the vitality of his own blood, keeps his cool long enough to tell the creature to ''go to California and find a Roger Corman movie to audition for.'' But, again, what saves Mr. King's stories from genre purgatory is his moral vision. He is in love with his readers, as someone in his income tax bracket might well be, and he wants to share his world view with them. He believes that primal, mythological beings and rites have extraordinary power; that we should stand in awe of nature; that good does not always beget good; that death is not necessarily dreadful; that violence is an expression of powerlessness; that creativity demands listening to inner voices; that madness attracts all of us; that true love never dies. S OMETIMES, as in ''Cain Rose Up,'' in which an anal-retentive type turns into a mass murderer, or in ''Nona,'' a failed attempt at Bergmanesque ghostliness, his visions run amok. Sometimes, as in ''The Monkey,'' a story about an evil toy, or in ''Uncle Otto's Truck,'' about a machine that avenges murder, the vision is predictable. But as a character in ''The Mist'' says, conveniently explaining the popularity of books about the supernatural: ''When the machines fail . . . when the technologies fail, when the conventional religious systems fail, people have got to have something. Even a zombie lurching through the night can seem pretty cheerful compared to the existential comedy/horror of the ozone layer dissolving under the combined assault of a million fluorocarbon spray cans of deodorant.'' The felicitous phrase is not always Mr. King's strong suit, but our very own Brother Grimm almost always speaks the truth. Susan Bolotin is the associate features editor of Vogue.

THE EYES OF THE DRAGON By Stephen King. Illustrated by David Palladini. 326 pp. New York: Viking. $18.95. IN a recent interview, the author of ''Carrie'' and ''The Shining'' called his novels ''the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and a large fries from McDonald's.'' The comparison is apt. Anyone surveying the contemporary American literary scene would be snobbish to ignore the best-selling phenomenon that is Stephen King. ''The Eyes of the Dragon'' is a departure from the horror genre in which Mr. King is so notably accomplished. Were it not for the author's devoted readers, the book would probably not have been aimed at a mass-market adult audience. A pellucid fairy tale, this new work is more elegant than any other novel Mr. King has written so far. He has used the full authority of his talent as a yarn spinner to create the atmosphere of a made-up bedtime story. The narrative address is that of a parent to a child: ''He was sometimes a cruel boy, often a sad boy . . . but even now I must tell you that I do not believe he was ever really a bad boy'' - reminding us strongly of A. A. Milne. The cadence of the book lends it to reading aloud, and the narrative has the intimate goofiness of an extemporaneous story told to a child. Thus, a magician trying to concoct a spell for invisibility ''succeeded only in making his nose nearly nine feet long and driving himself insane. And there had been fingernails growing out of his nose.'' Located in a remote fairy-tale past, the story is free of the pop jargon and vulgarities that Mr. King has used in his other novels to create a plausible setting for his horrors. From the book's first words - ''Once, in a kingdom called Delain'' - we know that we must suspend our disbelief just as completely as if we were listening to a tale by Andersen or Grimm.  ''The Eyes of the Dragon'' is about two princes, one strong and heroic and one weak and flawed. Peter is the older brother, destined to be king and well suited for the job. His younger brother, Thomas, is envious and sniveling and easy prey to the evil machinations of the magician Flagg, adviser to the elderly and ineffectual King Roland. The characters are often full of charm and even touching in the way that George Lucas's characters in ''Star Wars'' are touching: friendship is the reigning virtue; in a sense, erotic love does not yet exist. The book manages not to be saccharine, and Mr. King is enough in control to display some deft self-parody (the narrator refers to the inhabitants of Prince Peter's dollhouse as ''the King family''). There is also an interesting authorial association with the evil magician, Flagg, who, like Mr. King himself, is a great cataloger of horrors. In winning the young Prince Thomas's trust, Flagg lets him in on a bit of magic: a secret room that looks in upon the King's private chambers through the eyes of a dragon's head that is mounted on the wall. Spying on his father through the eyes of the dragon, Thomas not only experiences the queasy disillusionment of the voyeur but also becomes the sole witness to Flagg's treacherous murder of Roland. How Thomas comes to grips with this unwanted knowledge is one of the book's themes, as is ''seeing'' in general. The desire to be scared is a childish impulse, belonging to innocence rather than to experience. Frightening escapist literature lets us escape not to a realm of existential terror - Heaven knows, there is enough of that in our adult lives - but to the realm of childhood, when, within some cozy setting, we were able to titillate ourselves with fear. Scary books and movies have the comfort of being finite - we can always close the book or walk out of the theater. With an entrepreneur's insight, Mr. King has understood and answered a profound and popular need. ''The Eyes of the Dragon'' also addresses the child within the adult. To the author's credit, it is written so simply and so honestly that the prose is only rarely sloppy or jarring. Lovers of detail will enjoy the painstaking pencil drawings by David Palladini.   I WISH I WERE HERE Invisibility was out of his reach, but by . . . reciting a number of spells, it was possible to become dim. When one was dim and a servant approached along a passageway, one simply drew aside and stood still and let the servant pass. In most cases, the servant's eyes would drop to his own feet or suddenly find something interesting to look at on the ceiling. If one passed through a room, conversation would falter, and people would look momentarily distressed, as if all were having gas pains at the same time. Torches and wall sconces grew smoky. Candles sometimes blew out. It was necessary to actually hide when one was dim only if one saw someone whom one knew well - for, whether one was dim or not, these people almost always saw. Dimness was useful, but it was not invisibility.  - From ''The Eyes of the Dragon.''

MISERY  By Stephen King. 310 pp. New York: Viking. $18.95. THIS is the midyear offering from the prolific bard of Bangor (''Eyes of the Dragon'' was released a few months ago and another novel is scheduled for release a few months hence), and, as such, ''Misery'' will undoubtedly perform as other Stephen King novels have - cresting to the top of the best-seller lists, splashing heavily with the Book-of-the-Month Club, weighing down the corners of thousands of beach blankets this summer. All of which, in an odd way, is unfortunate. Success has a way of diminishing value and obscuring actual worth. The numbers attached to a book (one million copies first printing, $400,000 promotional budget) gain more attention than the words the book contains. It is easy to lose sight of the realization that ''Misery'' is a novel that would probably demand considerable interest even were it not from the writing phenomenon that is Stephen King. Mr. King has been justifiably acclaimed as a modern master of the horror story; he fills his work with demons, ghosts, vampires, beasts and seemingly ordinary folk who control extraordinary powers. His books stem from the traditions of Poe, Lovecraft, perhaps a bit of Ambrose Bierce. ''Misery,'' however, seems to belong to a different genre. To begin with, it contains only two characters: Paul Sheldon, a best-selling author, and Annie Wilkes, a psychotic, utterly deranged former nurse. The story takes place within the limited confines of a single house - indeed, almost exclusively in one room - in a rural part of the Colorado mountains. The protagonist, Sheldon, has just completed what he considers a ''literary'' novel - far different from the 19th-century historical potboilers that have made him an immense commercial success. Those books have featured a plucky, beautiful, indomitable young woman named Misery. In the last of the series, Sheldon, to his great delight, finally killed her off. Or wanted to. In drunken celebration of his new, contemporary book, he runs his car off a road in the midst of a snowstorm. He awakens, legs mangled, rescued - a word one uses gingerly - from death by the insane nurse. She is, by coincidence, a devoted fan. So devoted that she will not counte-nance Misery's literary demise, and through drugs and torture she forces the hapless Sheldon to write a resurrection of Misery. A private edition, Sheldon thinks. With a first and only printing of exactly one. The standard King fan will warm up to the gruesome nature of this relationship. Blood flies. The nurse has an unfortunately gory habit of lopping off important (but not essential) appendages belonging to her captive. Can the hero-writer survive? Will he escape? Will he turn on his tormentor? This book is built on a single cliff and hangs there throughout its length.  But the novel functions as well on a more sophisticated level. Mr. King evokes the image of Scheherazade. He muses on the literature of possession and the idea that art is an act in which the artist willingly becomes captive. He delves deeply into the psychology of creation, and it is to his credit that much of the tension in the book stems from the devilish dilemma the author-hero discovers: his book based on psychotic demand is actually quite good, by far the best he has written. He is, in a wonderful touch, compelled to finish it -and to save it, as well as himself, from destruction. For all writers who have faced the torture of a blank page, this is a delicious irony: that real torture can solve the problems of writer's block. SHELDON is well drawn and we see the entire story from his perspective: we willingly go along with him as he searches for a way out of his problems, those of his literary creation and those created by his captor. Nurse Wilkes is seen only through his eyes. She alternates between childish glee and ax-wielding madness. She hasn't much depth but remains a single-dimensional hulking horror throughout the book. Wilkes is expected to provide the terror that traditional King fans demand. Is she the type of character who frightens us so much that we can't turn off the light until the book is finished, and who then lurks first in shadows, then in subsequent nightmares? I do not know if she is successful on that score. Ultimately, I think ''Misery'' is probably far less viscerally frightening than most of Mr. King's offerings. There will be no sweaty palms, no tightened throats while reading this book. That will probably disappoint some fans. It shouldn't. Even if ''Misery'' is less terrifying than his usual work - no demons, no witchcraft, no nether-world horrors - it creates strengths out of its realities. Its excitements are more subtle. And, as such, it is an intriguing work. John Katzenbach's most recent novel is ''The Traveler.''

By Stephen King. 310 pages. Viking. $18.95. IN the opening pages of ''Misery,'' the protagonist wakes up from a coma in excruciating pain and tries to take stock: ''He was Paul Sheldon, who wrote novels of two kinds, good ones and best-sellers. He had been married and divorced twice. He smoked too much (or had before all this, whatever 'all this' was). Something very bad had happened to him but he was still alive.'' What had happened, it gradually dawns on Paul, is that he had been out celebrating the completion of a ''good'' novel, ''Fast Cars'' - having two years earlier put an end to his best-selling Misery series by killing off its heroine, Misery Chastain. He had gotten high on champagne, gone driving in a Colorado snowstorm, skidded on a mountainside, and flipped his car. Now he is in bed in a farmhouse somewhere. His legs are smashed and screaming with pain. He is being nursed by a large blank-gazed woman, who feeds him drugs periodically to kill the pain. The woman introduces herself as Annie Wilkes, the No. 1 fan of his Misery series. She found him in his wreck, recognized him and brought him home to her remote farmhouse. She doesn't like ''Fast Cars,'' the manuscript of which she found in his traveling bag. It's confusing and the language is profane. She's extremely upset about the death of Misery Chastain, the paperback account of which she's just finished reading. She wants Paul to get well and write a book bringing Misery back to life. In fact she insists on it. Now this situation might seem to have the makings of a comedy, but in Stephen King's hands, it isn't the least bit funny. With mounting anxiety, Paul realizes that he can't use his legs and that he's hooked on pain-killers, completely cut off from civilization and wholly dependent on this rather peculiar woman, who, to punish him for the language in ''Fast Cars,'' makes him wash down his pills with the soapy water she's just used to clean his room, and then forces him to burn his only copy of the manuscript. Bit by bit, he comes to understand that Annie Wilkes is not only peculiar but ''dangerously crazy.'' He will have to write a new Misery book just to save his life. On the other hand, she'll probably kill him as soon as he finishes. So he must write and write, just like Scheherazade. The portrait Mr. King draws of this madwoman is diabolical. She's exquisitely logical yet altogether unpredictable. No matter how far ahead Paul Sheldon schemes, she's always one jump ahead of him, waiting to inflict more punishment. Indeed the lengths to which she goes to torture Paul will prove too much for some readers, and could be considered gratuitously sadistic if the subject of ''Misery'' were nothing more than terror and violence.  But unlike much of Mr. King's fiction, this novel is more than just a splendid exercise in horror. Its subject is not merely torture, but the torture of being a writer. Not only must Paul create under pressure a story he doesn't particularly want to tell, but he must also make it plausible, even inspired, for Annie Wilkes is a shrewd connoisseur of storytelling, what one might call the ultimate editor and critic. Under her tutelage, the experiences of meeting a deadline and being cut take on terrifyingly literal meanings. On top of the pressure to create, Paul runs into other obstacles. The ancient Royal typewriter Annie has bought for him is missing its ''n,'' so the manuscript has to be gone over by hand. Soon the machine throws its ''t'' and ''e,'' the two most common letters in the English language. Added to this inconvenience, Paul suffers the usual perverse moods of writerly despair. ''The truth,'' he tells himself when the new Misery book begins to go well, ''was that the increasing dismissal of his work in the critical press as that of a 'popular writer' (which was, as he understood it, one step - a small one - above that of a 'hack') had hurt him quite badly. It didn't jibe with his self-image as a Serious Writer who was only churning out these . . . romances in order to subsidize his (flourish of trumpets, please!) REAL WORK! Had he hated Misery? Had he really? If so, why had it been so easy to slip back into her world?'' In other words, for all her craziness, Annie Wilkes becomes Paul Sheldon's literary muse, and as muses go she probably isn't too much worse than average, her main fault being a tendency to punish more literally than most muses do. In fact, considered as a metaphor, the whole story of ''Misery'' is really not much more than the struggle to write a novel, from the pain of confinement, to the sense of being drugged, to the anticlimax of completion: ''It was always the same, always the same -like toiling uphill through jungle and breaking out to a clearing at the top after months of hell only to discover nothing more rewarding than a view of a freeway - with a few gas stations and bowling alleys thrown in for good behavior, or something.'' Of course a lot of blood gets spilled in the denouement, but then, in the struggle between a muse and a writer, somebody's going to have to die in the end. Even with all the violence, justified or not, ''Misery'' is one of Mr. King's best. All things considered, it's a winner.

By Stephen King. 558 pages. Putnam. $27.95. THE hero of Stephen King's latest bloodboiler, ''The Tommyknockers,'' is, believe it or not, a drunk. He is a poet named Jim Gardener, or Gard, as his only friend, the novelist Roberta (Bobbi) Anderson, calls him. In the opening chapters of ''The Tommyknockers,'' he falls off the wagon while on a poetry-reading tour, and, in an episode quite entertaining for its rage and excess, makes a scene at a party that gets him banned from poetry readings for life. Eight days later, he comes to lying on a stone breakwater at Arcadia Beach, N.H., recalling little of the time since the party. He feels so hopeless he decides to jump into the ocean. But then something tells him Bobbi Anderson needs him. So instead of killing himself he hitchhikes to her house in the woods near Haven, Me. There he finds bad enough trouble to drive him right back off the wagon. By the end of what follows you come to identify closely with drunken Jim Gardener. Partly this is because he is about the only decent man in a crowd of very ugly characters. But mostly it's because if you've read to the end of ''The Tommyknockers'' it means you've got problems with addiction almost as serious as Jim Gardener's. I freely confess to being an addict of Stephen King. I got hooked by his good novels - ''The Shining,'' ''Pet Sematary'' and ''Misery.'' So I keep on reading the ones that are not so good, ''Christine,'' ''The Talisman'' (which he wrote with Peter Straub) and ''It.'' This latest one is impressively bad. It shamed me into realizing just how far gone I am. The plot declines pretty steeply after that rollicking faculty-party scene. The trouble that Bobbi Anderson is in is that she's tripped over something made of metal that is sticking out of the ground in the woods near her house, and whatever it is has taken possession of her, reminding her of the nursery rhyme:  Late last night and the night before,  Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers,  Knocking at the door.  I want to go out, don't know if I can,  'cause I'm so afraid  of the Tommyknocker man. Somehow this isn't particularly scary. Nothing about Tommyknockers - which, according to Mr. King's research, are either tunneling ogres or ghosts that haunt deserted mines or caves - is particularly scary. Nevertheless, at the climax of an early scene in the novel, Bobbi telepathically communicates the jingle to her friend.  And: ''Jim Gardener screamed.'' Eek? From this point on, we are subjected to repetition, implausibility, an illogically switching point of view, manipulative narrative leaps forward and backward in time, countless teeth dropping out as the citizens of Haven begin to ''become'' whatever has seized control of them, and a tiresome amount of bleeding and vomiting. A lot of vomiting. What the novel finally boils down to is mostly green slime. It is about as real and horrifying as that glop for children celebrated in Saturday-morning television ads for being yukky. If they make a movie out of it they're going to use up all the plastic. And yet like Gard in his cups, one keeps going back for more. It's hard to resist the sheer energy of the storytelling. When Mr. King backs up to fill you in on a development, he not only disappears over the horizon, he also circles the globe and returns with every gruesome oddity under the sun. The tasks that he undertakes, like showing the effect of Bobbi's discovery on an entire town, might exhaust many writers. But Mr. King succeeds in dreaming up nearly endless variations of the horror and in making his town fairly teem with his grotesques. It doesn't hurt that he knows Maine life and that he can sketch its types with malicious humor. One keeps trying to swear off the stuff. After all, as Mr. King himself points out through the mouth of one character in ''The Tommyknockers,'' his friend and sometime collaborator Peter Straub undertook more or less the same fictional exercise in his horror novel ''Floating Dragon,'' about a cloud of poison gas that gets loose and drives an entire town nuts. But darn it, when Mr. King attempts even a tired stunt, he does it so much better than the other fellows do. So I guess what ''The Tommyknockers'' proves is that Stephen King can do anything he wants to. We already knew he could grip us with good horror stories and so-so horror stories. Now he has shown that he can grip us with a lousy horror story as well. Anybody who can make me read a book called ''The Tommyknockers'' has to be some kind of genius.

THE TOMMYKNOCKERS  By Stephen King. 558 pp. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $19.95. IT doesn't matter that in this one a flying saucer -not vampires, telekinesis, Wendigos or a demonic clown in the drains - invades Stephen King Country; nor does it matter that this small Maine town is called Haven instead of Jerusalem's Lot or Derry. The science fiction trappings only add a new decor to the nightmare Stephen King tells over and over: something terrible comes Down Home and draws all its inhabitants, whether we like them or not, into its power. The story is frightening each time because the likable characters are so appealing they seem incorruptible. But then. . . . The Tommyknockers live in a giant spaceship buried for eons in the backyard of self-sufficient Bobbi Anderson, who writes westerns. Bobbi feels compelled to dig it out; her dog becomes strangely revitalized; she digs some more; she turns into a mechanical genius. Then her former lover Jim Gardener, known as Gard, turns up. He is an alcoholic poet crazed by visions of nuclear disaster and thinks the ship might contain an alternate power source that will save the world. Bobbi and Gard dig it out together - and terrible things happen to the citizens of Haven. Teeth fall out; minds get taken over; Stephen King plays cadenzas on his obsessions with menstruation and vomiting. The first third of ''The Tommyknockers'' is wonderful. With his usual eerie effortlessness, Mr. King attaches us to Bobbi and Gard, taunting us with menace neither they nor we can define. When evil starts gobbling Haven with a vengeance, swollen prose and comic-book grue spurt out one authentic gem (a little boy's magic show) and instill in us a creeping terror of good country folks. The last third of the novel is Armageddon, as is usual with Mr. King. In his early novels, Stephen King certified his authenticity by dropping brand names, but now instead of Flair pens and Marvel Straight cigarettes he pours out torrents of literary allusion. H. G. Wells, Stephen Jay Gould, James Dickey, Doris Lessing, Mother Goose, Stephen King himself (shamelessly), Herman Melville and The Who are only some of the people woven into this fat book. (Toward the end, Gard mutters: ''It's hard to spend such a long time thinking you're . . . Homer. . . . and discover you were . . . Captain Ahab all the time.'') It's hard to take such epigrams seriously; it's virtually impossible to take seriously the cumbersome machinery whereby the Tommyknockers do or don't do their murkily defined mission. But Mr. King's presumption that we are afraid of everything makes him a great and terrible storyteller - even when he is saying ''EEEEOOOOOOARRRHMMMMMMM!'' or ''Hurts! It hurrrrr - .'' Whether he is making these noises or quoting ''Moby-Dick,'' we believe him. Nina Auerbach, who teaches English at the University of Pennsylvania, is the author of ''Woman and the Demon'' and ''Ellen Terry: Player in Her Time.''

The Dark Half  By Stephen King  431 pages. Viking. $21.95. This latest of Stephen King's horror novels, ''The Dark Half,'' is a considerable comeback from the mechanical silliness of his previous one, ''The Tommyknockers,'' which was possibly his worst. One can understand why his publisher holds high hopes for the present book, having announced a first printing of a million and a half copies, which would surpass the record for fiction set by the million-copy first printing of ''The Mammoth Hunters'' by Jean Auel. One key to what makes ''The Dark Half'' work is that it combines what was successful in two of Mr. King's earlier books - the threat that the dead world posed to the living in ''Pet Sematary,'' along with the problems of being a successful writer that were so bloodily exploited in ''Misery.'' This mix may sound grotesquely contrived to readers familiar with those books: something like Dr. Faustus meeting the fat lady with the hatchet. And, in fact, ''The Dark Half'' does have its problems getting out of the ground, so to speak. We learn first that Thaddeus Beaumont got good news and bad news when he was an 11-year-old. He discovered his talent as a writer. But he also started having violent headaches and hearing the sound of sparrows twittering. A fit of fainting led to a skull X-ray, and the X-ray led to brain surgery and the removal from his prefrontal lobe of - gasp! - ''a single blind and malformed human eye'' and ''part of a nostril, three fingernails and two teeth.'' Thaddeus had apparently committed the not medically uncommon act of absorbing in utero his fraternal twin, and 11 years later the onset of adolescence had triggered the development of its remains. Flash forward now 28 years to Thad Beaumont as a 39-year-old, reading a story in People magazine. It is 1988; Thad has an attractive wife, a baby son and daughter who are twins, and a mixed career as a writer - mixed because while Thad has shown promise as a literary writer, he has achieved best-sellerdom as a writer of violent crime novels under the pen name George Stark. The story in People reports that Thad has decided to ''kill'' George Stark. An accompanying photograph even shows Thad and his wife shaking hands over George Stark's gravestone, whose epitaph reads: GEORGE STARK 1975-1988 Not a Very Nice Guy That night, Thad has a nasty nightmare about a tour of the underworld he is taken on by George Stark. The next day, the head groundskeeper of Homeland Cemetery in Castle Rock, Me., where the People photographer posed the mock burial of Stark, discovers a large hole in the turf surrounded by fingermarks and footsteps. A few hours later, a local man is found dead beside a nearby road. He was apparently beaten to death with his own prosthetic arm. Now, that hole in the cemetery's turf is almost as big as the one in the plot logic of ''The Dark Half.'' Both Mr. King and Thad Beaumont have a lot of explaining to do when whatever crawled out of the graveyard goes on a razor-wielding rampage, leaving fingerprints identical to Thad's, yet insisting when Thad and the police finally confront it, that it is none other than the writer George Stark. The hard work of explaining the plot's logic may account for why ''The Dark Half'' is unusually talky and cerebral for a thriller by Stephen King.  But while they are explaining, Mr. King and his persona wax surprisingly eloquent on the psychological hazards of being a writer - on the strain of concurrently believing and not believing a story you might happen to be telling; on the need of writers to create fantasy characters who compensate for what the writers perceive as their own shortcomings; on the possibility ''that the compulsion to make fiction was no more than a bulwark against confusion, maybe even insanity,'' and on the likelihood that in the act of conceiving an evil fantasy one might also invent an evil creator. And talk about the artist who creates to heal his wounds: it turns out that what George Stark really wants is for Thad to continue using him as a pen name to keep his body from decomposing. Not insignificantly, the novel is crammed with playful hommages to other writer (George Stark's home town is Oxford, Miss.), including an author's note in which Mr. King declares: ''I'm indebted to the late Richard Bachman for his help and inspiration. This novel could not have been written without him.'' Richard Bachman, of course, is the pen name under which Mr. King wrote five of his novels. Regardless of the novel's logic, we are swept along by the sheer vitality of the narrative voice. And eventually the logic does lock into place, and we finally begin to believe in George Stark as ''the word become flesh, you might say.'' At about this point in ''The Dark Half,'' Mr. King shifts over from the Down East vernacular that enlivens much of his prose (''Simple as knitting kitten-britches'') to the poetic image that animates his powerful conclusion, one of the most effective he has yet written. (''The sparrows rose into the hazy sky in a black cloud,'' it begins, ''wings whirring with a sound that was like thunder turned to thinnest lace, throats cheeping.'') Typically of Mr. King, he has borrowed the idea for this image from an earlier writer. But of course he fully acknowledges his debt to Daphne du Maurier. Then, with equal typicality, he matches the power of ''The Birds,'' and maybe even surpasses that story by a degree or two.

THE DARK HALF  By Stephen King.  431 pp. New York: Viking. $21.95. This is not the first time that Stephen King has written a dark allegory of the fiction writer's situation. ''Misery'' (1987) is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death. Mr. King's new novel, ''The Dark Half,'' is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes, the fratricidal twin who occupies ''the womblike dungeon'' of his imagination. Thaddeus Beaumont is the writer in question. At age 11 he writes his first story. Around the same time he begins to get excruciating headaches, which culminate in a convulsion. Surgery reveals something startling - first an eye, then other small fragments of an incompletely absorbed twin that's lodged in his brain. This sort of ''in utero cannibalism,'' according to his doctor, is not unusual, although rarely is anything left undigested, as it is in Thad Beaumont's case. The operation is a success, and Thad grows up to be a mild-mannered professor of creative writing, a doting husband and the father of twins, a modestly successful writer of novels with titles like ''Purple Haze.'' But under the pen name of George Stark he is the best-selling author of ferocious thrillers like ''Sharkmeat Pie,'' the protagonist of which is named Alexis Machine because he kills like one. Circumstances force Thad to own up to his pseudonym, which in any case has become irksome. He has decided to go it on his own, to lay his fictional self to rest. He and his wife even hold a mock burial service for George Stark, papier-mache tombstone and all. But one morning a man-sized cavity is discovered at the site. Footprints lead away. Very soon, people begin to die horribly, in particular everybody associated with Thad's decision to bury George Stark, whose prose style governs the graphic and gruesome descriptions of the murders. For George Stark has materialized. As Stark himself puts it, ''The word became flesh, you might say.'' But George Stark is not content to be merely undead. He wants to be alive entirely. He wants Thad to begin another novel under Stark's name. In fact, he wants to collaborate with Thad, to learn how to write, to become independent. Unless Thad complies, Stark will truly fade out of existence, for his flesh has begun to rot, decay, stink and ooze fluids, although no outside force seems capable of destroying him. Thad is forced to comply, for Stark has taken his wife and children hostage. As the collaboration gets going, Stark begins to heal; Thad develops running sores. On the whole, Mr. King is tactful in teasing out the implications of his parable - never mind an author's note that acknowledges a debt to ''the late Richard Bachman,'' Mr. King's own pseudonym, without whom ''this novel could not have been written.'' No character in the novel comes right out and says, for example, that writers exist (at least to readers) only in their writing, that each person (at least to himself) is his own fiction, that the writer's imagination can feel alien to him, a possessing and possessive demon, a Dracula arisen to prey on the whole man and his family. Nor does anyone in the novel say outright that reality inevitably leaks fiction, which then floods reality, that reality and fiction feed on and feed each other, that they are at war yet they are twins - so identical that attempts to say which is which only lead to more fictions. Such things are better left unsaid, anyhow. Stephen King is not a post-modernist. He is, however, a very good storyteller. ''The Dark Half'' mostly succeeds, as both parable and chiller, in spite of occasional cliches of thought and expression and bits of sophomoric humor (the F.B.I. is ''the Effa Bee Eye,'' marijuana is ''wacky tobaccy''). At the end, the decent family man wins out, but at a cost - which is how it should be. Most readers, I believe, will want decency and reality to triumph, but only with some reluctance, only after their most monstrous imaginings, like George Stark, have been unearthed and indulged. And few writers around are better than Stephen King at giving readers what they want. George Stade, a professor of English at Columbia University, is the author of a novel, ''Confessions of a Lady-Killer,'' and the editor in chief of ''European Writers,'' a multivolume reference work.

44,Stephen King,1991-09-29,"By RICHARD E.

With THE WASTE LANDS (Donald M. Grant, Box 187, Hampton Falls, N.H. 03844, $38), Stephen King resumes his chronicle of the odd, lethal quest of Roland of Gilead, first described in ""The Gunslinger"" and continued in ""The Drawing of the Three."" These books constitute his most ambitious and exotic project to date, a continuing series collectively titled ""The Dark Tower."" While the books share with Mr. King's horror novels bizarre villains and frequent eruptions of violence, they are otherwise a distinct departure: the series is set not in rural Maine but in what Mr. King calls Mid-World, a realm that parallels and occasionally overlaps our own world. The emphasis here is on Roland's long trek across the blasted landscapes of his world, filled with ""death and murder and madness,"" in an attempt to reach the enigmatic Dark Tower, rather than on any single contest with some sort of resilient monster. And while the references to popular culture are as constant as in his other books, the series seems to owe more to Joseph Campbell's popularization of the myths and fables of the hero than to the gaudy comic books and horror films of Mr. King's youth. The tale, he notes in a foreword, was inspired by ""and is to some extent dependent upon Robert Browning's narrative poem 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.' "" Mr. King's Roland is a laconic, updated version of a knight-errant, representative of ""the civilizing forces that kept people from killing each other enough of the time to allow some sort of progress,"" who travels with a pistol rather than a sword. As the last gunfighter in his world, which is on the brink of extinction following a series of disasters (and which sounds like a futuristic version of the United States), Roland feels compelled to reach the Dark Tower, ""which rules not just this world but all worlds,"" in an attempt to redeem Mid-World and, Mr. King hints, our own world as well. Roland recruits his companions on the journey from modern Manhattan; he is able to manipulate ""doors"" that allow him to enter and leave our world, taking those he chooses with him. ""The Waste Lands"" deals largely with the adventures of this band as they fight off a variety of lethal (though somewhat rusty) cyborgs, have generally unpleasant dealings with the few remaining inhabitants of the city of Lud, and draw closer to solving the riddles surrounding the importance of the Tower. While ""The Waste Lands"" seems at times an uncertain hybrid of horror and fantasy, at its best it demonstrates a subtlety and an assured sense of pacing new to Mr. King's massive body of work.

Needful Things By Stephen King 690 pages. Viking. $24.95 A new shop has opened in the town of Castle Rock, Me., the fictional setting of such previous thrillers by Stephen King as ""The Dead Zone"" (1979) ""Cujo"" (1981), ""The Tommy knockers"" (1987), ""The Dark Half"" (1989) and two novellas, ""The Body"" (which became the movie ""Stand by Me"") and ""The Sun Dog."" The new shop is called Needful Things, and it opens during an unseasonably warm spell in October 1991. The first person to enter it is 11-year-old Brian Rusk. Inside he finds a tall, kindly man in a smoking jacket who introduces himself as Leland Gaunt. Though there isn't much on display, Gaunt asks Brian to say off the top of his head what he would like most in the world. Brian tells him, ""Sandy Koufax,"" meaning a 1956 Sandy Koufax baseball card from the Topps series, whereupon Gaunt goes into his stock room and returns with the very card, signed ""To my good friend Brian, with best wishes, Sandy Koufax."" And though it is actually worth over $100, he lets Brian have it for 85 cents, plus a small favor he would like Brian to do for him. The second customer to visit Needful Things is Polly Chalmers, who runs a nearby shop called You Sew and Sew and is the lover of the sheriff of Castle Rock, Alan Pangborn. Polly has a painful case of arthritis in her hands. Eventually she too will find her heart's desire in Needful Things.  Leland Gaunt will charge her very little for it, but he will also ask her for a favor. What is the nature of these mysterious favors? One can reveal that they are relatively harmless pranks played on victims that Brian and Polly hardly know or care about. Beyond this it is not really fair to say anything, because Mr. King manages to tease some 278 dramatic pages out of this mild-sounding situation without spilling a drop of human blood. Then, of course, all hell breaks loose and we're off on another horror ride, with Mr. King cackling insanely in the background and rubbing his hands together like a fun-house Lady Macbeth. What it comes down to is that there's a lot of unleashed rage in Castle Rock, what with the Baptists mad at the Catholics for planning a Casino Nite to raise money, what with Wilma Jerzyck mad at Nettie Cobb for owning a dog that barks occasionally and what with Head Selectman Danforth (Buster) Keeton 3d mad at Deputy Sheriff Norris Ridgewick for giving him a ticket for parking in the police department's ""crip space,"" as the characters typically refer to it. There's a lot of greed in Castle Rock, too, or ""pride of possession,"" as one character refers to it. Together, the anger and the greed are highly combustible. ""Mr. Gaunt thought of himself as an electrician of the human soul,"" Mr. King's narrator says.  ""In a small town like Castle Rock, all the fuse boxes were lined up neatly side by side. What you had to do was open the boxes . . . and then start cross-wiring."" Then ""you turned on the juice.""  As always, one is bowled over by Stephen King's prodigious capacity to milk every situation for its dramatic possibilities, by his ability to line up vast landscapes of dominoes whose toppling will concatenate catastrophically, and by his sheer inventive energy. The technique of misrecognition that makes ""Needful Things"" go is as old as Plautus's ""Menaechmi,"" but Mr. King's loving celebration of violence once again sweeps the reader in its path. What Mr. King can do with particular skill is make the reader familiar with a large cast of characters and then, as crisis builds upon crisis, bounce from one situation to another without having to re-establish who the characters are. In ""Needful Things"" he pushes this technique to new limits. An entire community comes to disastrous life. More unnervingly, he has the capacity to activate one's every anxiety, no matter how irrelevant it may seem to the situation at hand. By degrees, he engages your whole being in dread. Reading him late into the night, you feel the walls closing in. Unfortunately, ""Needful Things"" is one of his apocalyptic nightmares, in which an entire town goes from the frying pan into the fire. This reader found it difficult to identify with a town. I prefer those books by Mr. King that involve one character or a single family and in which the story is told from a limited point of view. For me, his best book remains ""Pet Sematary"" (1983), about a father who loses his son to Hell, with ""Misery"" (1987), about a tortured writer, a distant second. So, luckily for me in a way, the tension of ""Needful Things"" eased up before the story was done. Reading it got to be like eating Cheese Doodles, if I may indulge for a moment in Mr. King's notorious brand-name idolatry. The mind kept going to the bowl long after the appetite was sated. And only because of momentum did I keep reading to the last salty crumb.

INSOMNIA  By Stephen King  787 pages. Viking. $27.95. ""When they are asleep,"" observed Aristotle, ""you cannot tell a good man from a bad one."" But what about a man who can't fall asleep? Is he good or bad? In Stephen King's latest novel of horror, ""Insomnia,"" the 70-year-old Ralph Roberts has been waking up earlier and earlier each morning -- 3:15 . . . 3:02 . . . 2:45 . . . 2:15 -- and staring up at the shadowy ceiling ""with eyes that felt as big as doorknobs."" He's afraid that soon he won't be sleeping at all, a prospect made all the more unpleasant by Ralph's recent loss of his wife to brain cancer. Ralph has tried every remedy from music to booze to staying up all night in the hope of exhausting himself. Nothing has worked. Ralph's short-term memory has begun to fail. His vision is playing tricks on him. Then one day, while Ralph is stocking up on Lipton Cup-a-Soup at the local Red Apple, his neighbor Helen Deepneau staggers in, badly bruised and cut. Ralph questions her and she reluctantly admits that her husband, Ed, has beaten her. When Ralph goes to the Deepneaus' house to question Ed, who was once Ralph's mild-mannered friend, Ed openly confesses that he beat up Helen because she signed a petition in support of inviting the feminist and abortion rights advocate Susan Edwina Day to speak at Womencare, a local clinic. Then Ed begins to rave: ""The thing is, I go down to the supermarket to buy baby-food, how's that for irony, and find out she's signed on with the baby-killers! The Centurions! With the Crimson King himself! And do you know what? I . . . just . . . saw . . . red!"" The Crimson King? What the heck is going on? Ralph wonders. He will begin to find out shortly, and his world will never be the same. After writing two shorter psychological thrillers, ""Gerald's Game"" and ""Dolores Claiborne,"" with ""Insomnia"" Mr. King has returned to the longer, shaggier form he is so practiced at, in which the protagonist ends up having to go down a hole in the earth and confront vast cosmic forces of hideous aspect and bad breath. ""Insomnia"" is set in Derry, Me., where something in the sewer system threatened the town's citizens in Mr. King's earlier novel ""It."" Except that this time out, the mayhem isn't quite as mechanically dualistic as it was in ""It"" and the similarly overbulky ""Tommy knockers."" This time out, the hero takes on a partner in the form of a widow, Lois Chasse, who lives down the street and who is also suffering from insomnia. Lois, too, has begun to see what a pharmacist has told Ralph is called hyper-reality, where people possess auras in the form of Day-Glo balloons on a string, unless of course they are about to die, in which case their balloons turn black. Like Ralph, Lois has begun to hallucinate three tiny bald-headed men in lab coats, one of whom likes to sneak up on people and sever their balloon auras with a rusty scalpel, which tends to bring on death.  When Ralph and Lois manage to confront these little bald-headed men -- by willing themselves onto a higher plane of hyper-reality -- they find them to be the three fates of Greek mythology: Clotho, the spinner of the thread of destiny; Lachesis, the measurer of the thread, and Atropos -- you guessed it -- the cutter of the thread (with his rusty scalpel). Clothos and Lachesis politely explain that while they work in behalf of a higher purpose, nasty Atropos is an agent of randomness. Atropos has interfered with higher purpose by randomly severing the aura of Ed Deepneau, with consequences that will soon prove apocalyptic. Only Ralph and Lois can set things right again, but to do so may cost them their lives. This, gentle reader, is why they are losing sleep. All of which may sound incredibly far-fetched, but amazingly enough it succeeds as storytelling. True, Mr. King develops each nuance of his tale with glacial ponderousness. As always, his text is as full as an old Sears, Roebuck catalogue with brand-name provisions and appurtenances. And not a thought or an action can occur without its being underlined by reference to some popular song or phrase or book. The most elusive specter in this story is a fresh idea or an original turn of phrase. Still, the narrative somehow holds you all the way to its fulminating climax. And this is followed by a scary-sweet aftermath that neatly resolves the story's exploration of aging and self-sacrifice. The only disconcerting thing is that the novel feels it must spell out its simplistic theory of heroism. As the narrator explains: Ralph's ""upbringing almost negated such nice moral questions as who was working for the good and who was working for the bad; the important thing was not to let the bullies kick sand in your face.  Not to be led by the nose."" Curiously, this not overly complex point is made in a slightly different way as well. There is one character in the story who each time he steps on stage is reading and singing the praises of a different modern poet; James Dickey, Stephen Dobyns, Robert Creeley, Hart Crane and Dylan Thomas are among the writers he recommends. The point he finally makes about all of them is: ""Modern poetry is not about music. It's about nerve, who has it and who doesn't."" Since this somewhat debatable point hardly needed such elaborate machinery to drive it home, one can assume only that Mr. King has indulged an enthusiasm and used his thriller as a sort of bookmobile to bring favorite new discoveries to his readers. Maybe such an inference is unfair on the grounds that fans of Stephen King are already eager poetry readers. Whatever the case, given the enormous size of Mr. King's audience and the uncanny compulsiveness of his latest thriller, a fortunate group of poets is going to be wheeled into a lot of homes.

ROSE MADDER  By Stephen King  Illustrated. 420 pages. Viking. $25.95. ""Rose Madder,"" the title of Stephen King's 29th novel, refers of course to the reddish pigment used in painting, on which depend important details of the novel's scary plot. But ""Rose Madder"" also sums up what the novel's heroine feels when she notices ""a single drop of blood, no larger than a dime"" on the sheet near her pillow while she is making the bed. The spot of blood reminds Rose Daniels of the punch in the nose her husband, Norman, gave her the previous evening when she spilled some iced tea on his hand. Remembering this punch makes her think of all the beatings she has suffered over the 14 years of her marriage, and in particular of the one in the midsection that ended her pregnancy. These memories make her angry. They make Rose madder and madder. So she finally gets up the courage to walk out on Norman. While he's at work, she finds his bank card, withdraws $350 from an ATM and takes a bus to a city several hours to the west. There, she makes her way to a shelter for battered women, gets counseling, meets a nice man, discovers her talent at reading aloud for recorded books and begins a happier new life. Yet this is no bittersweet comedy like Anne Tyler's recent ""Ladder of Years."" As Rose settles into her new routine, the narrative viewpoint switches to Norman Daniels, who is also getting madder and madder. He doesn't like it at all that Rose has left him, and he particularly resents her audacity in taking his bank card. He intends to track Rose down and give her a talking to ""up close,"" as he likes to put it. Since he is a police detective highly expert at tracking people, he seems likely to hunt Rose down. Now while this may well be an unpleasant prospect, it is hardly the horrifying stuff of a typical Stephen King novel. After all, what more can Norman do than drag Rose back to where she was trapped before? The threat to Rose isn't even as acute as the less-than-world-ending plights of the heroines in ""Gerald's Game"" and ""Dolores Claiborne,"" two recent books by Mr. King whose focus on the psychology of sexual abuse ""Rose Madder"" shares. Or at least the menace seems limited when we first meet Rose's husband.  But we should trust Mr. King not to leave things only modestly threatening. Before very long, Norman seems capable of ending several people's worlds. First, Mr. King pumps him up to be a maniac who not only murders people who thwart him but also bites them and eats their parts, a homage to Hannibal Lecter underlined by a character who mentions Thomas Harris's ""Silence of the Lambs."" Then, just as Norman begins to seem too monstrous to be credible, Mr. King adds a mythic dimension to his plot. This is done quite cleverly. Rose visits a pawnshop to sell her wedding ring, which Norman has told her cost the price of a new car. As she absorbs the news that the ring is almost worthless, her eye falls on an amateurish painting that attracts her powerfully. She trades her ring for it, discovers that its creator's name is Rose Madder and takes it home with her. After hanging it on the wall of her room, she notices that it has begun to change in peculiar ways. Soon she finds herself able to enter the world it depicts. Here she gets caught in an eerie play of mythic forces that reflect and eventually resolve the conflict between her and her husband. Some of this subplot seems forced, which is hardly surprising in light of how far-fetched it is. Also annoying are several of Mr. King's more familiar mannerisms: his habit of identifying his characters and situations with references to pop-culture cliches instead of taking the trouble to describe them freshly, and his insistence on spelling out every implication of his plot to the point where nothing is left to the unspoken subtext. And every so often you are made a little uneasy by how much he seems to relish being inside the head of his racist, misogynist, psychopathic villain. But ""Rose Madder"" is rarely dull. It builds to a vivid climax. Norman's insane misogyny is balanced by a sensitive portrayal of the way battered women recover their self-respect. And if Mr. King occasionally lays his story on a little thick, one can forgive him. As Rose's brutal husband reflects while he pieces together the false identity under which he plans to infiltrate his runaway wife's new world, ""it was better to have a story and not need one than to need one and not have one."" In ""Rose Madder"" Mr. King has a rousing story when he needs one and when he doesn't.

48,Stephen King,1998-09-21,"By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPTSEPT. 21, 1998 BAG OF BONES By Stephen King 529 pages. Scribner. $28. Stephen King seems to me most frightening when the monsters in his stories are psychological instead of supernatural, when they haunt the subconscious instead of the cellar. (See ''Misery,'' ''Dolores Claiborne,'' ''Gerald's Game'' and several of his novellas and short stories.) In this respect, his latest tale of horror, ''Bag of Bones,'' gets off to a most promising start. On a very hot day in August 1994, Mike Noonan, a best-selling novelist, casually says goodbye to his wife, Johanna, as she leaves their house in Derry, Me., to run a shopping errand. ''The next time I saw her, she was on TV,'' Noonan, the novel's narrator, reports. ''That's how you identify the dead here in Derry -- no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles on the walls and long fluorescent bars overhead, no naked body rolling out of a chilly drawer on casters; you just go into an office marked PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope.'' Jo has died suddenly of a brain aneurysm, and, almost as bad, she turns out to have been newly pregnant with the couple's first child, a girl they would have named Kia. Mike is naturally devastated by his loss. Jo was his best friend and they had tried for a long time to conceive a child. He finds himself weeping uncontrollably and even after the normal mourning period he remains uninterested in making new friends. Worse, he can no longer write the novels that have made him a modest millionaire. (His genre is ''Lovely Young Woman on Her Own Meets Fascinating Stranger.'') Every time he sits down in front of his word processor he is seized with such terror that he sometimes even vomits. He hides his problem from his agent and his publisher and to keep up with their demands he's forced to draw on the surplus of manuscripts he has stored in a bank vault. After four years of this he begins to think his writing career may be over. ''The bookberry tree had died,'' he reflects. ''Bag of Bones'' is full of references to writers, nearly 40 of them by my rough count, from Daphne du Maurier to George Seferis, Guy de Maupassant to Mary Higgins Clark, Tom Clancy to Somerset Maugham. Even Mr. King's title, ''Bag of Bones,'' is partly a literary reference. Although Noonan has never confirmed the attribution, he believes that it was the English novelist Thomas Hardy who said, ''Compared to the dullest human being actually walking about on the face of the earth and casting his shadow there, the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones.'' (Of course this has a more macabre and literal meaning in the novel as well.) So you quickly come to expect that Noonan's block is the prelude to a major exploration of the writer's unconscious, which would be particularly fascinating coming from Mr. King, considering the terror of his turn of mind and the rate at which its material spills out. You think it most significant that one of the novel's epigraphs comes from Melville's ''Bartleby,'' the novella about a scrivener who lays down his pen and utters the famous words, ''I prefer not to.''  As events turn out, this is not the direction in which ''Bag of Bones'' is headed. Instead, Noonan begins to have a repeated awful nightmare about the lakeside house called Sara Laughs that he and Jo used to summer at in western Maine. When he decides that the only way to solve his block and end his nightmare is to go back to Sara Laughs, he becomes embroiled in everything supernatural from poltergeists to telepathy to telekinesis to time travel. Arriving at his summer home, Noonan meets a charming 3-year-old girl named Kyra (a name too close for comfort to that of his own unborn Kia), whom mysterious forces seem to want to kill to avenge some community crime in the distant past involving the black woman named Sara Tidwell for whom Sara Laughs was named. As Noonan confronts these forces, the story rises to a powerful crescendo in which the most far-fetched plot contrivances willingly do Mr. King's bidding. Yet as impressive as it may be, the story leaves you with the feeling that it is an afterthought tacked on as a way of avoiding whatever the novel's subject started out to be. Underneath and a little off to the side is the theme that Mr. King has introduced but never quite comes to grips with, namely the sources of the impulse to write and whatever stimulates or impedes them. These are touched on repeatedly: in several more references to Melville's ''Bartleby''; in an account of how Hardy ''stopped writing novels himself after finishing 'Jude the Obscure' and while he was at the height of his narrative genius,'' and in several of Noonan's comments about himself. Once he arrives at Sara Laughs, he finds that Jo had been there before she died and that, unbeknown to him, she had been writing something of her own. This both disturbs him and enables him to begin writing again. But he does so without much pleasure. ''I wrote until midnight came,'' he reports. ''By then the thunder had faded away but the heat held on, as oppressive as a blanket. I turned off the I.B.M. and went to bed . . . thinking, so far as I can remember, nothing at all. . . . The writing had burned off all thoughts of the real world, at least temporarily. I think that, in the end, that's what it's for. Good or bad, it passes the time.'' In a typically out-sized performance by Mr. King, this ambivalence toward his craft pervades mysteriously. It makes you wonder if with Melville's Bartleby he is saying about his work, ''I prefer not to.'' It makes you wish that he had confronted in ''Bag of Bones'' what his novel seems really to be about.

49,Stephen King,1999-04-15,"By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPTAPRIL 15, 1999 THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON By Stephen King 224 pages. Scribner. $16.95. Even if you stay on the Appalachian Trail, things can get plenty scary, as Bill Bryson makes clear in his recent best seller, ''A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail.'' But wander just a little way off of it, and the world can all but come to an end. Or so it would seem from Trisha McFarland's experience in Stephen King's frightening new novella, ''The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.'' Trisha is a 9-year-old who has to relieve herself one June morning while setting off on a six-mile hike along the trail from an unincorporated township in western Maine to North Conway, N.H. She can't get the attention of her mother and older brother up ahead, who are so involved in bickering with each other that it's ''like some sick kind of making out.'' So at a fork in the trail she seeks privacy by going a little way along the path they're not traveling and stepping into the woods. Then, when she's finished, she figures she can catch up by simply walking across the gap in the Y and rejoining the main trail. ''Piece of cake,'' she thinks. ''There was no chance of getting lost, because she could hear the voices of the other hikers so clearly.'' Mistake. Big mistake. Now, what you might expect Mr. King to do at this point is to summon up at the very least a homicidal pedophile on the loose or a rabid werewolf running amok to terrorize poor Trisha, who while a gritty young thing and tall for her age is even afraid of the dark. All she's got going for her is her minimal knowledge of the woods, a backpack with her lunch in it and her Walkman radio, on which she can listen to her beloved Boston Red Sox, in particular her special hero, the relief pitcher Tom Gordon, whom she admires for having ''icewater in his veins'' and whom she considers one of the handsomest men in the world. But surprisingly in this story that seems almost to have written itself, Mr. King leaves his heavy-breathing monsters mostly out of it and relies on the simple things about being lost in the deep woods that would upset most of us, like insects, snakes, hunger, thirst, cliffs, swamps, thick foliage with thorns, disease, extreme weather, noises in the dark and our own overheated imaginations. Oh, and something that seems to be stalking Trisha. Something very large. Something that grunts. Something capable of ripping the head of a deer from its body. Something that we know Trisha is going to have to deal with directly before she gets out of the woods. The question remains, will Trisha get out? Along with a threatening natural world, what oppresses the reader is the knowledge that as the god of his fictional universe, Mr. King is perfectly capable of destroying a child; in his past fiction children have often not been guaranteed survival. To make matters worse, the world that Trisha is struggling to return to is not that much better than the one she is lost in. Her parents have divorced and are fighting over her and her brother. Her father drinks too much. Her brother is unhappy in school; as she steps off the trail, the last words she hears from him are, ''I don't know why we have to pay for what you guys did wrong!''  Trisha's religious faith is limited to a glimmer she apprehends of what her father calls ''the Subaudible,'' or ''something that keeps most of us from dying in our sleep.'' Just as she lacks a vocabulary to describe what she is experiencing in the woods, she is missing the words to pray. The only certain thing in her life is Tom Gordon, whose pitching exploits she listens to while huddled frightened in the dark, and who walks by her side and reassures her when she gets sick enough to hallucinate. A couple of flaws taint ''The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.'' It's hard to believe that even a Red Sox announcer would refer to the 1998 version of the team's archrivals as ''those pesky New York Yankees,'' which seems a little like calling the Mark McGwire of that season a singles hitter. And I've never heard of any trout that had ''fish-scales.'' More damagingly, Mr. King insists on several times stepping beyond Trisha's point of view to report how the search for her is going, what her parents are up to and how her brother is feeling. While all of this information could easily have been conveyed in the context of Trisha's experience -- for instance, by reporting it on her radio (as in fact her being lost is announced) or by having her extrapolate it from past experience (as in fact she imagines her family's reaction to her crisis) -- working it in as Mr. King has done only dissipates the narrative tension he has built. Still, reading the novel produces several satisfying moments of feverish terror where you can picture Trisha's bones bleaching in a sunlit landscape utterly indifferent to her being. As the narrator puts it: ''The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted. She knew that now. She was only 9, but she knew it, and she thought she could accept it.'' Thanks to Mr. King's gruesome imagination, you as a reader feel the sharpness of those teeth. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

50,Stephen King,1999-05-16,"By ANDREW ESSEXMAY 16, 1999 The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon By Stephen King. Scribner, $16.95. Nine-year-old Trisha McFarland is hopelessly lost in the woods. Out for a morning hike with her bickering mother and brother, she runs off to relieve herself and discovers she can't find her way back to the path. Over the following 224 pages (a veritable chapbook for the indefatigable Stephen King), Trisha wanders for a week in the mosquito-infested forest with nothing but her wits, her Walkman and the pitching prowess of her hero, the dreamy Red Sox reliever Tom Gordon, to guide her. As Trisha fights to stay alive, King demonstrates his empathy for the inner lives of children and an outdoorsman's knowledge of the edible wild flora of Maine (Trisha survives on checkerberries, beechnuts and fiddlehead ferns). Later, when it becomes clear that something strange in the woods is stalking Trisha and decapitating deer -- It wasn't a joke and it wasn't a dream. It was death and madness standing or crouching or perhaps perching'' -- King delivers his trademark dose of horror. Hungry, hunted and just a little bit ''nutzoid,'' Trisha relies on Gordon's grace under pressure -- and his imaginary interventions -- to overcome her fear and end her ordeal. Though the idea of a 9-year-old girl obsessed with a relief pitcher rather than, say, the Spice Girls is a bit of a stretch, the idea of ''closing'' as a metaphor for conquering demons is a deft addition to King's crowded field.

51,Stephen King,2000-10-05,"By JANET MASLINOCT. 5, 2000 ON WRITING Memoir of the Craft By Stephen King 288 pages. Scribner. $25. When Stephen King summons his early years in his new memoir, he recalls being teased by a flatulent, 200-pound ''Misery''-prototype baby sitter and horribly tormented by the doctor who drained his infected ear. He describes the ''dirt-floored, rock-walled, spider-infested'' basement from which he and his brother Dave put out a homemade newspaper. He describes the formative experience of working at a laundry that served a seafood restaurant, where the dirty table linens ''stank to high heaven and were often boiling with maggots.'' In other words, developing a best-selling ghoulish imagination was not a stretch for him. He lived in a Stephen King world long before the Stephen King writing style was born. And when he began to describe that world in print, he inevitably met the teacher who told him: ''What I don't understand, Stevie, is why you'd write junk like this in the first place. You're talented. Why do you want to waste your abilities?'' Somewhere that teacher must be wondering whether having the last laugh is such an empty cliche after all. Now it's Mr. King's turn to give instruction. And his warmly conversational book about literary craftsmanship should interest even those who find something oxymoronic in its conception. As someone who describes the authorial brainstorm of setting off a bomb in ''The Stand'' because the story was becoming overpopulated, he may not be the most noble of stylists, but there's no denying that he knows how to make a story fly. So he takes a helpful, nuts-and-bolts approach to the budding writer's basic concerns while giving them a King-like spin. ''The dictum in writing classes used to be 'write what you know,' '' he notes. ''Which sounds good, but what if you want to write about starships exploring other planets or a man who murders his wife and then tries to dispose of her body with a wood-chipper?'' Well, first things first. In the commonsensical tone of a man who is often asked how to write 30-odd hugely popular books, create a one-man Internet publishing revolution and become Hollywood's favorite literary brand name, Mr. King advocates some valuable basics. He recommends reading lots of books if you expect to write one, for instance, and making sure your work space is television- and video-game-free. He advocates a structured work day, and says that he sometimes finds himself ''perky as a rat in liverwurst'' when the day's writing comes more easily than expected. As someone who clearly loves books (and who reveals astute, varied tastes in a recommended reading list), Mr. King advocates an autodidactic approach over the communal experience of writing classes. ''It is, after all, the dab of grit that seeps into an oyster's shell that makes the pearl,'' he writes, ''not pearl-making seminars with other oysters.'' As both devoted reader and literary practitioner, Mr. King has pet peeves worth appreciating. He passionately hates adverbs, which means that ''He hates adverbs'' would be a better way of saying so. Ditto for loathing passive constructions in place of active ones, in a point that he makes with typical no-nonsense bluntness. ''I think unsure writers also feel the passive voice somehow lends their work authority, perhaps even a quality of majesty,'' he says. (He also prefers a simple ''says'' or ''said'' to fancier forms of dialogue attribution.) ''If you find instruction manuals and lawyers' torts instructive, I guess it does.''  In the arena of storytelling he argues for interesting situations rather than ironclad plotting. (''Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.'') And ''On Writing'' is liberally illustrated with examples from the author's own work, as in the ''what if'' premises from which his stories have grown.  (What if ''vampires invaded a small New England village?'' That's ''Salem's Lot.'' Or ''a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog?'' That's ''Cujo.'') Most important for the fledgling fiction writer he recommends not trying to imitate the popular formulas perfected by anybody else. ''You can't aim a book like a cruise missile,'' he maintains, warning his readers ''not to commit intellectual dishonesty in the hunt for the buck.'' ''On Writing'' began as a compendium of tips like these, in a tone suitable for lecture circuit or Internet discussion. It also included a sharp, pungent account of Mr. King's growing up, finding a soul mate named Tabitha, going through a rocky phase that involved taking drugs and drinking mouthwash, and eventually discovering his professional destiny. Then, through an outrageous twist of fate, it became something more. He writes in the book's final section about being hit by a runaway van while walking along a Maine road, of waking up to hear the driver say he was heading for ''some of those Marzes-bars they have up to the store,'' and of having the grotesque idea that he had nearly been killed by one of his own characters. Monstrous as it was, that event turned ''On Writing'' into a much stronger, more meaningful book than it might have been. Halfway through this project, when he was hurt, Mr. King incorporated his revivifying return to work into this book's narrative in ways that will make readers realize just how vital it has been for him. And the accident is eloquently described here, as a sterling illustration of all the writing guidelines that have come before. For once, less is more in Mr. King's storytelling, and the horror needs no help from his imagination. ''There have been times when for me the act of writing has been a little act of faith, a spit in the eye of the despair,'' he writes. In the end, with unexpected intimacy and dignity, ''On Writing'' becomes the essence of those times. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

52,Stephen King,2000-10-08,"By FREDERICK BUSCHOCT. 8, 2000 ON WRITING A Memoir of the Craft. By Stephen King. 288 pp. New York: Scribner. $25. LIKE Charles Dickens, Stephen King endured hard times in childhood that he evokes in his fiction; like Dickens, he can write as he wishes and reach his loyal readers no matter how reviewers respond to his books -- On Writing,'' I'm sure, included. The book affects a tough, down-to-earth manner: the blue-collar guide to hammering stories together. It seems that King doesn't want to address the need to work with more delicacy, and perhaps he doesn't see one. Clearly, he wishes to make some statements about how he writes and how you can, if you want to, imitate his ways. He knows a lot about writing for magazines and about reaching vast audiences, and many of his anecdotes are interesting. The first section, ''C.V.,'' is about King's ''odd, herky-jerky childhood,'' and how he was raised by a single parent. His mother, widowed young, always poor, is portrayed as charming and dedicated, sacrificing herself for him and his older brother. King remembers a baby sitter, Eula-Beulah, in terms of cruelty, torture and the abundant generation of body gas. He remembers throwing up on his mother's shoes when Eula-Beulah locked him in a closet. He remembers the pain of having his eardrums punctured by a doctor, and adults who lied when they said that the puncturing wouldn't hurt. Movies, comic books and stories took the imaginative boy away from his difficult world, and the writing of stories -- his first customer was his mother -- gave the young boy ''an immense feeling of possibility . . . as if I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed doors and had been given leave to open any I liked.'' So King started, though in trying circumstances, as most writers start: seeking to woo the adults, needing to make a world that he might order and control. King evokes a frightening ''tangled wilderness area'' in Connecticut, where his mother moved her family for a while, bordered by a junkyard and a train track -- This is one of the places I keep returning to in my imagination,'' he writes -- and in it he sets a recollection of a childhood lower-intestinal emergency and his cleanup with leaves that turn out to be poison ivy. The marriage here of that biological problem and the nightmare area to which King returns suggests a certain infantilism in the person, I suppose, but also a key element in the novels. Though not as poetically, King captures, as Dickens did, the frights of childhood: the rebellion of the body; the transformation of nature -- those leaves -- into affliction; the metamorphosis not only of people -- a baby sitter becomes a gaseous monster -- but of machines (typewriters, cars, motors in factories), all of which were elements of his childhood and of his young adulthood as a worker at low-paying, exhausting jobs in rural Maine. King's wife, the novelist Tabitha King, is celebrated throughout the book, and in a famous anecdote she rescues from the garbage pail three single-spaced pages that, with her encouragement, King turned into ''Carrie'' (1974). These pages -- written when King was paid $6,400 a year as a high school English teacher -- became his first published novel, for which Doubleday paid $2,500 for hardcover rights and Signet paid $400,000 for paperback rights. After the autobiographical section of about 100 pages, we have roughly 150 pages of advice on writing, some of which is, well, singular. ''Remember,'' the tyro is enjoined, ''that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word . . . but it probably won't be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.'' This rule will come as a relief to writers for whom thought is painful.  About meeting an editor who years before turned down a fledgling effort by King, but who now stands in line for his autograph, King has this to say: ''Talk about your ghosts. Man oh man.'' Apparently, while hesitation and cogitation might have brought other words to bear, King could not have bettered the original inspiration. The novice writer is told that ''writers have different skill levels when it comes to dialogue,'' that ''thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and nearsighted. Overdescription buries him or her in details and images. The trick is to find a happy medium.'' Over all, this injunction seems to be the most encompassing: ''Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex and work. Especially work. People love to read about work. God knows why, but they do.'' A postscript titled ''On Living'' consists of 18 moving pages about King's being run over and nearly killed, his struggle to live, and his and Tabitha's collaboration on his survival through writing. Their courage is exemplary. King says, ''I'm convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing.'' He later writes, ''Grab that book you were looking at off the shelf again, would you?'' A reader might be forgiven for wondering if the root of much bad writing could also be fearlessness. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

53,Stephen King,2001-03-15,"By JANET MASLINMARCH 15, 2001 DREAMCATCHER By Stephen King Scribner. 620 pages. $28. In 1999, as he explained in ''On Writing'' last year, a reckless driver on a Maine road changed Stephen King's life. Now, in the big, dynamic novel that is his first since being grievously injured, it's possible to see how that accident changed his definition of horror, too. To be sure, in ''Dreamcatcher'' Mr. King supplies enough spooky effects and space aliens to meet his usual quota of weird frissons and throws in enough messy gastrointestinal side effects to keep this book from seeming to have gone soft. But beneath all that, there is also a new urgency. In this craftily phantasmagoric story about dreams, telepathy and extraterrestrials, the emphasis is less on fear than on the shared will and capacity to survive. ''The body is either stupid or infinitely wise, but in either case it is spared the terrible witchery of thought,'' one of the book's characters reflects at the end of the War of the Worlds that is furiously set off here. ''It only knows how to stand its ground and fight until it can fight no more.'' Of the four old high school friends from Derry (site of Mr. King's ''It'' and ''Insomnia'') who reunite for what will prove an alien-plagued hunting trip, it is Jonesy who will have the toughest fight. And it is Jonesy who sounds most familiar. ''Detective novels and horror movies: those were the things that floated Jonesy's boat,'' Mr. King explains about his alter ego, who teaches at a Boston college and is about to cross the street one day when the unthinkable happens. He is about to take the fateful steps, distracted by a set of thoughts that will later prove premonitory, since ''Dreamcatcher'' is loaded with strange harbingers and visions. ''This is a mistake,'' Mr. King writes about Jonesy's most mundane action. ''This is also how lives change forever.'' Jonesy gets hit, and his heart stops twice, bringing him close to what his friends call ''stepping out.'' But now he has recovered enough to join an alcoholic car salesman named Pete, a suicidal psychiatrist named Henry and the group's all-purpose joker, Beav, at a remote hunting cabin known as Hole in the Wall for one last outing. Not one of them has much to live for until the day a strange old coot named Richard McCarthy wanders into their cabin. It is because of McCarthy that the four old schoolmates, soured by life, have reason to consider the alternative. McCarthy is a little strange. How strange? Stephen King strange. He's missing prominent teeth, which gives him a vampire look. He seems to have wandered by from 50 miles away. He has the date and the weather forecast wrong, and otherwise shows signs of perhaps having come from another planet, which is not too far off the mark. What's worse, McCarthy has spectacular flatulence, and Mr. King simply burns to describe it over and over again. This leads to ever more scatological stuff throughout the book and eventually to enough horrible red-yellow fungus to cover most of Maine. But ''Dreamcatcher'' also has some very neat tricks in store. It develops that aliens are simply using other bodies as vehicles and that something about Jonesy's altered state makes him ideal for a takeover. Thus he finds himself ''turned out of his own body like lint out of a pocket,'' with a space autocrat named Mr. Gray at the helm instead.  Technically, anything of Jonesy's is Mr. Gray's to invade. But Jonesy imagines his own memory as a kind of storeroom full of boxes, and he scrambles to hide certain ones whenever Mr. Gray's attention is distracted. ''This was a magic place, a make-it-up-as-you-go-along place, and the most marvelous thing about it, Jonesy supposed, was that everybody had one,'' Mr. King writes. It's apparent that, in writing ''Dreamcatcher'' with such imaginative gusto, he's had quite a satisfying sojourn in that place of his own. The book's sentimental invention is a retarded boy named Douglas who is called Duddits and who was saved by the other four from school bullies in 1978. Since then, they have been his protectors, and he has brought out the glimmer of a telepathic bond among them. It's a power that comes dramatically into play once it develops that spreading telepathy is one of the strange things the aliens have been doing in the Maine woods. Another has been broadcasting the voices of Barbra Streisand, Bugs Bunny and other famous people to insist that actually, no, the aliens are not a threat to the population. In a busy, vigorously told, increasingly trippy story, Mr. King also includes an anti-alien paramilitary operation at the hands of one Abe Kurtz, whose nuttily dictatorial behavior would be clear enough without mention of ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''Apocalypse Now.'' These parts of the book tend to become most tired, but on the whole, ''Dreamcatcher'' isn't a tale to let attention flag. Mr. King, for all his lovingly captured belches and much worse, writes more fluently than ever, and at times with simple, unexpected grace. ''And to those of you who have come so far, thank you for reading my story,'' he writes in an author's note on the book's last page. The dreamcatcher of the title, the woven Indian charm meant to ward off nightmares, is eventually allowed to take on spiritual significance, presenting Mr. King in a newly New Age light. But if he would prefer to move on from Pennywhistle, the demonic clown who terrorized Derry in ''It,'' to the thought that we all share a consciousness that can bind us together, why not? It makes for great midnight reading. And he's earned the right. A book review of Stephen King's ''Dreamcatcher'' on Thursday misidentified a character in an earlier King novel, ''It.'' The name is Pennywise, not Pennywhistle. A front-page contents entry in the Arts section referred to the book incorrectly. It is the first novel from Mr. King -- not the first book -- since his road accident in June 1999. In October he published a nonfiction work, ''On Writing.''

54,Stephen King,2001-04-15,"By COLIN HARRISONAPRIL 15, 2001 Dreamcatcher By Stephen King. 620 pp. New York: Scribner. $28. WHEN Stephen King was struck by a van in June 1999, suffering hip, leg and lung injuries, his readers quite naturally wondered what would be left of him after the bones healed. Like the rest of humanity, writers hurt in severe accidents don't always regain their previous abilities. (Hemingway, for example, was never quite the same after a near-fatal airplane crash in Africa when he was 54.) With the publication of ''Dreamcatcher,'' his first full-length novel since his accident, and written while he convalesced, King offers his gigantic readership the opportunity to see whether he's still got the stuff. They needn't worry. Set in King's familiar shotguns-and-pickups milieu of small-town Maine, ''Dreamcatcher'' is a frenzied, multilayered, ever-accelerating nightmare. The tale begins as four middle-aged buddies -- Beaver, Jonesy, Pete and Henry -- take their annual hunting trip in a remote cabin in Maine called Hole in the Wall. As with his previous work, King builds up the details of his characters' lives in a naturalistic way; we see these men, we hear their banter, we know their fears. In short, we like them, which probably means some of them will die. Beaver is a jokester carpenter, Pete a hard-drinking car salesman, Henry a psychiatrist contemplating suicide and Jonesy an associate professor at a college in Boston. Jonesy, by the way, is also recovering from a nearly fatal car accident in which he broke two ribs and shattered a hip. (Yes, that sounds a lot like what happened to King, but hold that thought a moment.) Each man has a mild gift of telepathy, which we later learn is the result of their shared high school experience with a retarded boy named Duddits, whom they saved from a gang of sadistic hoods. Four telepathic men in a hunting cabin in the middle of nowhere is not so creepy, is it? Not until another hunter, McCarthy, stumbles out of a snowstorm. McCarthy is disoriented, losing his teeth and suffering from a shocking flatulence problem -- this last perhaps not so surprising, given that the poor guy is unknowingly host to an extraterrestrial weasel who promptly shows us a mouthful of needle-sharp choppers. Yes, another spaceship has landed on planet earth, and soon our four hunters are separated and fighting for their lives. But haven't we seen a lot of funny little spacemen before? Sure, King seems to admit (he refers repeatedly to H. G. Wells, ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''), and it doesn't matter -- you're going to like mine anyway, especially because they spread telepathy and a funny red fuzz that kills people. The United States government dependably shows up to quarantine the whole tract of woods, blast the remaining aliens and slaughter the animals infected with the nasty fuzz. Leading them is a retired Air Force officer, Abraham Kurtz -- another ironic reference -- who provides the tough-guy element. Describing the naked and unarmed aliens who have landed, he says: ''I have seen these things at work for 25 years or more, and I tell you this is it, this is the invasion, this is the Super Bowl of Super Bowls, and you fellows are on defense. They are not helpless little E.T.'s, boys, waiting around for someone to give them a New England Tel phone card so they can phone home.''  Although the subsequent action scenes are very well done -- King truly delights in the gruesome -- it is the novel's cross-wired psychic structure that is most fascinating. We follow the men forward through the developing alien crisis and backward in time through the remembered boyhoods of the four friends, understanding in the odd logic of telepathy how everything connects to everything else, and in particular how the spooky, funny-talking Duddits connects to aliens. We hardly care that King's storytelling virtuosity flatteringly presupposes a corollary story-reading ability; this is a book that has to be read in enormous gulps. The telepathic effect of the alien presence so infects the characters that they constantly overhear one another's thoughts (which does allow for a certain amount of expeditious plot resolution), and the swirling mind-meld reaches such a bizarre pitch that Jonesy, whose body has been inhabited by an alien named Mr. Gray, is able to communicate in real time with the characters seeking to find him even as they listen to him argue with Mr. Gray over the meaning of what happened with Duddits decades back. Somehow it all makes galloping, hallucinatory sense. As suggested, ''Dreamcatcher'' is suffused with recollections of Jonesy's car accident, and (notwithstanding King's own reference to his recovery in an author's note) it would be disingenuous not to admit the heightened context of these descriptions: ''So often, Jonesy thought, there was no one to blame when the dust cleared. And even if there was, what good did it do? You still had to live with what was left.'' Although ''death had brushed by him on a sunny day in March, and Jonesy had no desire to call it back,'' he thinks about the accident constantly, wondering if he is ''Jonesy No. 1, the confident pre-accident Jonesy, or Jonesy No. 2, the more tentative survivor who spent so much of his time in a tiresome state of physical discomfort and mental confusion.'' Deep into the novel, King conjures not only Jonesy's painful physical therapy after the accident but the awful event itself: ''He's unconscious in the back of an ambulance but watching himself, having an actual out-of-body experience.'' Reading through these contemplative passages to find King himself is tricky, of course; a book finally exists independently of its author, and ''Dreamcatcher'' is about many more things than Jonesy's accident. But doing so is irresistible and strangely satisfying, for while providing another complete ''Stephen King'' novel, titled ''Dreamcatcher,'' King manages to communicate to us directly -- and perhaps to himself as well -- that he is still very much here, still smiling that scary half-smile of his as we quickly flip the pages.

55,Stephen King,2002-09-23,"By JANET MASLINSEPT. 23, 2002 FROM A BUICK 8 By Stephen King 356 pages. Scribner. $28. Stephen King was driving from Florida to Maine in 1999 when nature called. He pulled off the highway, found a gas station and used the restroom. Then he walked behind the building and lost his footing, sliding down a slope and almost landing in a stream. That was when nature -- his nature -- called upon him to dream up ''From a Buick 8.'' This is a novel about a haunted car, and Mr. King has threatened to make it his last: not just his last scary-auto book, but also the last novel he publishes that is not already planned. However serious he is, the evidence on the page indicates that he still loves telling stories, knows every trick when it comes to manipulating readers and continues to redefine his definition of horror more interestingly as he grows older. The title Buick cooperatively coughs up freaky creatures and happenings, but this book is about things you cannot see. The vintage Buick can be found sequestered in Shed B, behind the state troopers' barracks in a small Pennsylvania town. And Mr. King will take his sweet time telling you what it is and how it got there. First he'd like to introduce the troopers themselves, who form a tightly knit unit with a long history and a tradition of devotion to duty. Mr. King reflects a larger national mood in appreciating the quiet heroism that goes with this territory. The new kid at headquarters is 18-year-old Ned Wilcox. His presence unnerves the old-timers because Ned's father was one of their own. Curtis Wilcox died in an auto accident in 2001, and his son would like to know more about what happened. But nobody really wants to tell him. And nobody wants him nosing around the you-know-what out back. Still, there it is ''over there in the Twilight Zone,'' the car that started all the trouble. And gradually, as Mr. King crosscuts between past and present and invites readers to make themselves comfortable around the campfire (''Come closer, all good little children, come closer, see the living crocodile''), the story starts emerging. It seems that the car first pulled into a local gas station in 1979, and its driver got out. (Art imitates life here.) And then he was never seen again. And then the fun begins. ''Fat and luxy on its whitewall tires,'' the Buick was installed in the shed because the troopers didn't quite trust it. It resembled a 1954 model, but came with a glass exhaust system, zeros on its odometer, no distributor cap or antifreeze or fan belt and not one speck of dirt on its tire treads. These seem to be tip-offs that it hails from the Great Used Car Lot in some other dimension. Sure enough, the Buick gives off warning signs. The climate around it becomes strangely cold, the air strangely electric. It emits an unusual (to say the least) peppermint-cabbage smell. It does perverse magic tricks; when a cage with two gerbils is left with the Buick, one gerbil simply disappears. Since the Buick seems to have had the same effect on one of the troopers, this is all greatly worrisome in the extreme. Since Mr. King has expectations to meet, ''From a Buick 8'' (with a title that is a homage to a Bob Dylan barnburner on ''Highway 61 Revisited'') must devote some of its energies to presenting what one character calls ''Hell's own movie-show.'' So out flies the one-eyed thing resembling a dead bat, to name just one of the Buick's calling cards. And the author delivers the requisite yucky stuff (''a thin and wrinkled yellow nightmare with a head that wasn't really a head at all but a loose tangle of pink cords, all of them twitching and squirming''). But he doles this out sparingly, and with more detachment this time. A certain degree of artful stalling is part of the process here, as in: ''He was still rummaging in the boxes of stuff he kept back there when the Buick exploded.''  Followed by, ''It did not literally explode, but there seemed to be no other word for what it did do.'' In a book that finds Mr. King paying more than usual attention to character development, dread will eventually supplant the more quantifiable forms of horror. As the troopers age and time takes its toll on them, ''From a Buick 8'' addresses fears of mortality and disappointment and above all fear of the endless unknown. ''You can only live with the lights on so much of the time,'' one character observes, in a book that is ultimately about uncertainty and darkness, though it never succumbs to gloom. ''The world rarely finishes its conversations,'' says the character who articulates the deepest fear found here. This is the horror: that you never know. In other words, there is something more disturbing than getting to the bottom of the Buick's mystery: discovering that it can never be fathomed, and that the world's chains of coincidence can never truly be understood. Certainly this is solemn stuff for a man who can still write, with his usual merry gusto: ''Maybe they were blisters. Or maybe, God help me, those things were its eyes.'' ''From a Buick 8'' winds up offering a less tidy resolution than might be expected. Maybe that is because Mr. King has told so many haunted-whatever stories before, and maybe it is because he regards the genre in a larger life-or-death context these days. In any case, this book effectively delivers its warning that each of us must face some ultimate Buick of the soul. And it is welcome evidence that Mr. King and his overheated imagination are still around. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

56,Stephen King,2002-09-29,"By LAURA MILLERSEPT. 29, 2002 FROM A BUICK 8 By Stephen King. 356 pp. New York: Scribner. $28. IT must get exhausting, inventing monstrous evils year in and year out, especially the sort of ancient, supernatural forces that start by insinuating themselves into the fabric of everyday life and grow to threaten everything sane and decent before being vanquished, against all odds, by a valiant band of unlikely heroes. You can see why Stephen King, who has done this many times, might get tired of it, might look around him at a world that certainly enjoys no shortage of terrors as it is, and write a book like ''From a Buick 8.'' It's still a horror novel, but it's one that gnaws away at the very premises of the horror novel. It knows what you want and expect from it, but it deftly gives you something else instead, something equally worth having and all the more pleasing for being a surprise. The novels King has published since 1999, when he was struck and nearly killed by a distracted motorist while walking along a Maine road, have been rattletrap affairs powered only by the redoubtable dynamo of his storytelling. ''From a Buick 8'' is a sleeker machine, even if at first it seems to revolve around the unexciting evil-car motif of King's 1983 novel ''Christine.'' The Buick in question, a 1954 Roadmaster in midnight blue, pulls up at a service station outside a small town in western Pennsylvania in 1979, driven by a mysterious man in black who promptly vanishes. Everyone who sees the car instantly knows that it's ''wrong.'' It's got an exhaust system made out of glass and a dashboard full of phony controls, for example -- and it just gives people the creeps. The service station turns this problematic vehicle over to Troop D of the Pennsylvania State Police, and they stash it near their barracks in an outbuilding they call Shed B, where it stays for the rest of the book, causing trouble. That's the story, boiled down to its bones, and story is usually the main attraction in King's fiction. ''From a Buick 8,'' though, is a phenomenon almost as exotic as the Buick itself: a King novel to read for voice and atmosphere, not plot. It's told mostly in the first person, by various members of Troop D, who are relating the history of their 23-year stewardship of the Buick. Their audience is Ned Wilcox, the 18-year-old son of Curtis, a trooper who was hit and killed by a drunken driver while he was standing next to a truck he'd stopped by the side of a two-lane highway. Ned has been hanging around the barracks doing chores, and when he asks about the gleaming vintage car out in Shed B, Sandy Dearborn, sergeant commanding, decides to initiate him into the troop's secret. ''When you got right down to it,'' Sandy explains, ''it wasn't a 1954 at all. Or a Buick. Or even a car.'' It's soon obvious that the Buick is a conduit to another dimension. Sometimes it spits out a repulsive creature or two from that world, and then it will suck in a gerbil, a frog or, alas, a human being from ours (the first casualty is Curtis's partner). The transplants that emerge on this end rapidly die and decompose. For complicated reasons, the troop's commander (Sandy's predecessor, Tony Schoondist) wants the whole thing kept quiet. It's hard to care much about the Buick, though; you can sense King's own indifference. Ned, patently a stand-in for the typical King reader, pesters Sandy for answers, but the older man resists. ''Tell me a story,'' he imagines the boy demanding, ''one that has a beginning and a middle and an end where everything is explained.'' They wrestle over how the story gets told. Ned doesn't appreciate the details or recognize the importance in how the Buick ''eventually became just another part of our day, like writing reports or testifying in court or cleaning puke off the floor mats of a cruiser or Steve Devoe's Polish jokes.''  ''I kept trying to give him a context,'' Sandy adds, ''and he kept repudiating it.'' King succeeds where Sandy (initially) fails: he shows you the mundane heroism of the troopers' lives and makes you care about that, not the spook show in Shed B. No horror emerging from the Buick can be worse than the nightmares of their job -- ''the smell of blood and busted guts and spilled gasoline and boiled rubber . . . like some hideous old acquaintance who would never move out of town; you smelled it and knew that somebody was dead or almost dead, that somebody else would be crying and screaming, that you were going to find a shoe -- hopefully not a child's, but all too often it was -- lying in the road.'' Then there's the legacy of their work and the unhealthy habits acquired to take off its edge, the retired troopers with oxygen tanks and drinking problems, the suicides -- all arising from the corrosive despair and stealthy self-hatred that stoic men are prone to and that King writes about so expertly. In one piercing scene (a scene any writer would be proud of), a trooper tries to persuade the female passenger in a truck he's pulled over to press charges against the man he's just seen punching her. He's almost sure she won't do it, tries speaking softly, wonders if barking orders wouldn't work better (''Doing what men said had pretty much become her life's work''), pities her, pleads with her, realizes he's lost her and thinks: ''She'd sit there until hell froze over'' or until he got angry enough ''to do something that would get me in trouble later. Like hit her. Because I wanted to hit her. If I hit her, at least she'd know I was there.'' And then, of course, there's Ned's father's pointless death. King isn't a subtle writer, and in case you miss the dozen or so times that someone proclaims that there are no answers or explanations -- either to the mysteries of the Buick or to the random tragedies of ordinary existence for which it stands -- he comes in at the end with an author's note to tell you the book's about ''the essentially indecipherable quality of life's events.'' And, yes, ''From a Buick 8'' presents a sentimental view of police work, hardly the whole truth, as some black drivers in New Jersey can surely testify. Yet it feels true enough in what it does choose to say, and in the reticent intimacy of this group of working-class men and women, with their shared everyday reality of coffee mugs, paperwork, grabbing a smoke out back, pulling over a truck with a flapping retread, peril, death and cleaning up afterward.

57,Stephen King,2004-06-20,"By BEN SISARIOJUNE 20, 2004 SONG OF SUSANNAH The Dark Tower VI. By Stephen King. Donald M. Grant/Scribner, $30. Stephen King is at his best when he's writing about dark things creeping into humdrum reality. But how about when he tries the opposite, planting a bit of reality in a realm of pure fantasy? King's ''Dark Tower'' series, his attempt at a Tolkien-like epic, is now in its sixth and penultimate installment, and the story has become dauntingly overstuffed and complex. King's band of outcasts, caught in a wasteland universe called Mid-World, have begun to converge in the real world -- or at least the real world as King sees it. Susannah, a black woman from 1960's New York who is possessed by a pregnant white woman named Mia, escapes to the Manhattan of 1999; Father Callahan (from King's novel '' 'Salem's Lot'') and young Jake Chambers pursue her, while the gunslinger Roland Deschain and Eddie Dean, another castaway from the 20th century, head to 1970's Maine to track down a not-yet- famous writer named Stephen King. The hokey illustrations, by Darrel Anderson, don't help untangle things. King's prose, sometimes indulgent, crystallizes whenever he leaves the netherworld; this suggests that his favorite fantasy is not the byzantine cosmology of another world but a skewed version of our own.

58,Stephen King,2006-01-23,"By JANET MASLINJAN. 23, 2006 Cell  By Stephen King  355 pages, with a 12-page addendum. Scribner. $26.95. Life is kind to the writers of horror stories these days. All they have to do is sit back and watch. So Stephen King's ""Cell"" invokes the events of Sept. 11, 2001, the kind of disaster in which ""clothes floated out of the sky like big snow."" It echoes the upheaval caused by last year's monstrous tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. It reflects the violent anarchy to be found in Iraq. It shivers at the threat of bioterrorism and the menace of computer technology. And it savages the ubiquitous hand-held telephones of the title. As this novel sees the world of cellphone communications, it's a Tower of Babel made of cobwebs. Here comes Mr. King, ending his nonsabbatical from writing straightforward horror fiction, to blow those cobwebs away. ""Cell"" begins with a big, graphic jolt. On a pleasant October afternoon in downtown Boston (beware any scene featuring an innocent ice cream truck), everything suddenly goes crazy. People attack strangers, break things and speak in wild gibberish, all as a consequence of the brain zapping that the book calls The Pulse. It has been delivered via cellphone. Only the Luddites and phone-phobes are safe. So far, so good -- although it would have been better had Mr. King not agreed to promote ""Cell"" with cellphone ring tones being sold by his publisher. Anyone who uses a cellphone (Mr. King does not) has been zombified: in a book dedicated to two pioneers in this thematic area, Richard Matheson and George Romero, Mr. King creates a ""Night of the Living Dead"" scenario with a technological twist. ""Except these people aren't dead,"" explains a still-sentient Boston police officer. ""Unless we help them, that is."" Mr. King spends part of ""Cell"" contemplating the essential darkness of human nature. Stripped of social constraints, the Pulse people create a Hieronymous Bosch tableau of hellish depravity. They can be found reeling, staggering, biting their own mothers or fighting over Twinkies. The author's mouthpiece, a comic book artist named Clayton Riddell, finds time to take the long view about this disintegration and comeuppance. ""Three days ago we not only ruled the earth, we had survivor's guilt about all the other species we'd wiped out in our climb to the nirvana of round-the-clock cable news and microwave popcorn,"" Clay observes. ""Now we're the Flashlight People."" But once the pyrotechnics of The Pulse are over and the exodus from Boston begins, much of ""Cell"" is a literal trudge. Clay is thrown together with a few de facto comrades, among them a teenage girl named Alice who gives the book its Lewis Carroll aspect. Together, they begin heading north, road by road, town by town. Clay is from Maine. (Where else? This is a Stephen King novel.) For not-so-imaginative motivation, the book gives him a son named Johnny, who may have been using a cellphone when the blight struck -- or may still be able to be saved.  The cell-from-hell premise gives this story an instantly powerful hook. But there are times when the book threatens to become all hook and no fish. Though ""Cell"" is not unduly long, it moves slowly and somewhat repetitively along its highway of horrors. And Mr. King is in no hurry to build upon the Pulse idea after he has deployed its initial shock value. When the book's overview begins to emerge, though, it justifies the dawdling. The zombies evolve in interesting ways. Midway through the book, Mr. King takes the story to a private school that has become a post-Pulse campground and reveals the telepathic patterns that have begun to shape collective behavior. It is the author's little joke that these messages are delivered via the worst easy-listening songs he can name, to the point where Lawrence Welk and ""You Light Up My Life"" become part of the apocalypse. ""Who is this guy?"" Alice asks, upon hearing Michael Bolton. ""Honeybunch,"" one of the story's elders tells her, ""you don't want to know."" By this private-school midpoint, the book has regained its initial steam. (The school's head, Charles Ardai, is named for the former Internet mogul whose Hard Case Crime series published ""The Colorado Kid,"" the experiment in detection that was Mr. King's last effort to stay unbusy.) Now the behavior of the undead starts to change quickly. And Mr. King's visions of shared thinking, flocking, parroting and telekinesis are not all that far removed from the real perils of Internet linkage and synchronicity. (""It's like being nudged by a hand, only inside your brain,"" one character explains, describing an all-too-familiar cyber-sensation.) In a final round that is worth the whole game, Mr. King suggests a form of salvation that could exist only in an eerily computer-connected and privacy-free world. ""Cell"" displays the author's habit of beginning with a real-world idea and following it into a hazy dreamscape, only to re-emerge from the vortex when his cautionary tale is over. In that sense, and in the visceral impact of its descriptions (out comes an old man's eye, with ""a loose, gobbety plopping sound""), this is a traditional King narrative studded with alarming signs of the times. To indicate that the author's ambitions exceed repeating himself, ""Cell"" ends with a facsimile of 12 handwritten passages of Mr. King's next and very different-sounding novel, ""Lisey's Story,"" scheduled for release in October. Unlike ""Cell"" ring tones, this is a welcome and legitimate form of promotion. ""Cell"" is graced with another gorgeous cover by Mark Stutzman, who translates Mr. King's thoughts into spectacular pulp illustrations. The cover depicts a smashed phone, an eerie figure, a burning city and what looks like a crushed cup from a popular coffee-shop chain. Watch out, Starbucks.

59,Stephen King,2006-02-05,"By DAVE ITZKOFFFEB. 5, 2006 CELL By Stephen King. 355 pp. Scribner. $26.95. They say it pays to steer clear of one's heroes, and after reading ""Cell,"" I can honestly admit I am scared as hell about the prospect of ever crossing paths with Stephen King. Because if King regards actual human beings the same way he thinks about the characters in his latest novel, his passion for enforcing rules of etiquette would most likely place him somewhere on the spectrum between Emily Post and Vlad the Impaler. If you're stingy or slow to help those in need, he may depict you hanged from an overhead light fixture with a bag pulled over your head. And don't let him overhear you fussily correcting other people's grammar, or he will imagine you driving a fountain pen into your brain, via your eye socket. Who knows what brutality King, a die-hard Red Sox supporter, would wish upon me for being a garden-variety Yankees fan? In ""Cell,"" the author's latest work of sadistic wish fulfillment, his wrath is largely directed at those little Lucifers who have cast God's natural order into disarray by talking constantly on their cellphones (""the devil's intercoms,"" as one character calls them). On the same day that the comic-book artist Clay Riddell has unfortunately chosen to be in Boston for a business meeting, a mysterious electronic pulse scrambles the brains of everyone using a cellphone, turning most of the populace into murderous zombies. And before you can say, ""They're coming to get you, Barbara,"" Clay finds himself in a scenario straight out of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" banding together with what remains of humanity to fight his way out of town, reunite with his missing son and figure out what he's going to do now with his unused rollover minutes. As you may recall from Aristotle's discussion of the form in the ""Poetics,"" an effective zombie apocalypse story should satisfy two conditions. First, it should fulfill an audience's desire to see aberrant acts of violence triggered by civilization's collapse, and in this respect ""Cell"" does not disappoint: there's still no other writer who takes as much delight as King does in rendering the sight of a soccer field's worth of zombies being charbroiled out of existence, or a poodle getting run over by a car (""Fluff at one moment; guts at the next""). Second, a good zombie tale should offer some fresh insights about basic human nature, if only to pass the time between episodes of cannibalism, and it's in this capacity that ""Cell"" turns out to be a bit brain-dead. Having never lived through an Armageddon by mutants myself, I could be wrong, but I somehow doubt that the survivors of such an experience would spend as much time as this novel's characters do remarking that there are as many cellphones in China as there are people in America, or bemoaning the state of contemporary rock 'n' roll radio, or saying things like ""In Freud's vocabulary, the idea of survival as the prime directive is expressed by the concept of the id.""  WHEN King sets his own id loose on the page, the results can be as startling as any of the intentionally scary moments. It's funny to see him include little potshots at Tom Clancy or shout-outs to William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, but what is a reader supposed to make of lines like ""Give a nice little gay guy from Malden a roomful of guns to play with, he starts to say yo just like Sylvester Stallone""? To my mind, what's most unsettling about ""Cell"" has nothing to do with the novel proper, but with the fact that Pam Huizenga Alexander, the daughter of H. Wayne Huizenga, owner of the Miami Dolphins, paid $25,100 in an online charity auction for the privilege of having a character in the book named after her brother Ray. The fictional Ray Huizenga provides crucial assistance to our hero, Clay, yet he exits the story by placing a pistol under his chin and blowing off the top of his head.

60,Stephen King,2015-05-31," By Laura Lippman Literary celebrity sounds like an oxymoron, but it does happen. Selling millions of books isn’t enough; readers have to feel a profound personal connection to the writer. J. K. Rowling is definitely in the club. James Patterson, probably not. Or consider this story, one told to me 20 years ago by a member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, the writer-rock band. (Now that might be an oxymoron.) The band stopped for breakfast at a small-town truck stop before the sun was up. This was pre-smartphone, pre-social media, practically pre-Internet. Yet by the time the band members returned to their tour bus, there were several people lined up, clutching copies of “The Stand,” eager to meet the band’s undisputed rock star, ­Stephen King. Yeah, that’s not creepy at all. But it does illustrate why King has special standing in his new novel, “Finders Keepers,” to examine the reader-writer relationship, which is increasingly a two-way street. What does a beloved writer owe his fans? Who’s the boss, especially in an era when disenchanted disciples can cyberstalk, tweet their fury at a less-than-cordial encounter or even self-publish fan fiction? King of course has worked this territory before, most notably in “Misery,” with a writer essentially enslaved by his No. 1 fan. But whereas Annie Wilkes was nuts, if you’ll excuse the clinical term, fans are not necessarily fanatics. The desire to establish a bond with a beloved writer is a form of communion — or so said Martin Amis, who has acknowledged he did precisely that with Saul Bellow. In “Finders Keepers” (the second entry in a planned trilogy that began with “Mr. Mercedes”), book-besotted Morris Bellamy uses the metaphor of a classic love affair to define his roiling emotions about his favorite author: “It was . . . just as fate had come between Romeo and Juliet. That comparison seemed both ludicrous and perfectly apt. He was a lover.” Alas for the object of Morris’s affection, John Rothstein, Morris feels betrayed. Rothstein will strike most readers as ­Salingeresque. He lives in seclusion in New Hampshire, his most famous book had a distinctive red cover, and it centered on an angry, rebellious young man. There’s even mention of a story with an eerily familiar name, “The Perfect Banana Pie.” And like Salinger, Rothstein stopped publishing in the 1960s but has continued to write about his most famous character, Jimmy Gold. Over the years, he has filled dozens of black leather ­Moleskine notebooks, which he then locks in a safe — another Salinger overlap — where he also keeps envelopes of cash. But there are echoes of other writers here, too. Rothstein’s famous trilogy, which began with “The Runner” and continued with “The Runner Sees Action” and “The Runner Slows Down,” feels like a nod to John Updike’s Rabbit books. Bellow and Philip Roth are invoked as Rothstein’s literary contemporaries; Roth lurks in the character’s very name. Indeed, Roth tilled this soil in “Zuckerman Unbound,” in which a would-be writer stalks the author of an enormously successful novel that sounds a lot like “Portnoy’s Complaint.” I couldn’t help remembering the assessment of Zuckerman’s literary agent: “First you lock yourself away in order to stir up your imagination, now you lock yourself away because you’ve stirred up theirs.” Roth’s Zuckerman may have been slightly paranoid, but King’s Rothstein gets his brains blown out on Page 14. Morris and two accomplices take off with the notebooks and at least $24,000. Of these three perpetrators, only one — Morris, the one who pulled the trigger and who cares more about the notebooks than the money — makes it through the night alive. Back in his hometown, identified only as the “filthy little city that residents called the Gem of the Great Lakes,” Morris brags about his score to a young bookseller he considers his only friend. The man’s horrified reaction catapults Morris into a blackout binge, and he wakes up in jail. The good news is that he’s not there for three murders. The bad news is that he has committed a particularly violent rape and faces life in prison. All of this, it turns out, is basically back story — King is a natural raconteur, confident of his readers’ interest, and so he’s unafraid to interrupt the novel’s present-day action with these flashbacks. But 35 years after Morris’s crime spree, there’s another family living in the house where he grew up, another young man susceptible to literature’s power. In a town where a lot of people are down on their luck, the Saubers are even more so; the father, Tom, was injured when a maniac drove a Mercedes into a crowd of people at a job fair, killing and maiming many. (Yes, that’s the opening scene from “Mr. Mercedes.”) Pete and his younger sister, Tina, are painfully aware that their parents’ marriage might not survive the fallout. When Pete finds a trunk full of cash and notebooks, he devises a way to use the money to help his family. He also finds himself under the spell of Rothstein’s Jimmy Gold — but Pete has an advantage the rest of the world does not: He has read the never-published fourth and fifth books in the series, books that correct the seeming betrayal that so inflamed Morris. After Morris is paroled, he goes to find the trunk he stashed before his arrest, and this is where the main characters of “Mr. Mercedes” finally return: It will fall to the retired cop Bill Hodges and his investigative partners, Holly Gibney and Jerome Robinson, to try to save the Saubers family. It’s a classic race-against-time story, one that benefits from King’s superb patience and pacing. Then, in a late-­appearing subplot that circles back to “Mr. Mercedes,” King introduces a supernatural element absent from the first book. To say more about this cliffhanger would be a spoiler, but part of me can’t help wishing King had stayed with classic crime fiction. It’s as if King’s restless imagination is a power that cannot be contained. He played it pretty straight in “Mr. Mercedes,” which just won the Edgar Award for best novel of 2014 from the Mystery Writers of America. Now he’s toying with the form, batting it back and forth to see if it’s still alive. His riskiest move, however, is creating a book — books — within a book. That’s tricky for any writer. Inevitably, the reader must accept, without much evidence, that the cited work is a masterpiece. (Or hugely popular, or something that hit the sweet spot of the zeitgeist.) I wasn’t persuaded that Jimmy Gold’s catchphrase — one that can’t be printed in a family newspaper — became a watch cry for thousands. Then again, if you described “Eat, Pray, Love” or “Fifty Shades of Grey,” they wouldn’t sound like plausible literary phenomena either. I did believe that Morris and Pete fell under Jimmy’s spell, and that’s what matters. If their final showdown is a high-stakes confrontation between good and evil — well, good grief, what did you expect? Pete is King’s ideal reader, a young man whose life is changed by the discovery of an important writer at a seminal time. If it is naïve or quaint to believe such discoveries are still made, then count me as naïve and quaint. Books can change lives and ignite passions. So, to echo the final line of King’s author’s note, here’s to the constant readers, even the ones who leave notes at coffeehouses where writers are reputed to work, offering up grisly plots for future books. Oh, wait — that coffeehouse thing happened to me. Gulp. FINDERS KEEPERS By Stephen King 434 pp. Scribner. $30. Laura Lippman’s most recent novel, “Hush, Hush,” was published in February.

61,Stephen King,2016-06-12,"By Denise Mina END OF WATCHBy Stephen King432 pp. Scribner. $30. At the start of this final installment of Stephen King’s trilogy featuring the retired police detective Bill Hodges, his hero is “pushing 70” and getting bad news from his doctor. Just how bad may be ominously presaged by the title. But Hodges, who runs a small private agency called Finders Keepers with his partner, Holly Gibney, is preoccupied by some other news that may be just as bad. His arch-nemesis Brady Hartsfield, the mass murderer he stalked in the trilogy’s first volume, “Mr. Mercedes,” seems to have returned to action, despite being confined to a hospital ward — his brain, if not his body, fully operational. Should Hodges devote himself to investigating Brady or should he take time to get treated for his rapidly worsening condition? Trying to answer that question only adds to the novel’s tension. A laconic character, Hodges has been easy company over the course of “Mr. Mercedes” and “Finders Keepers.” Maintaining a tight structure, King uses “End of Watch” to loop back to Hodges’ handling of the explosive episode that started off the trilogy — Brady’s decision to plow his car into a line of people waiting at a job fair, killing eight of them and severely injuring almost twice as many. Supposedly rendered comatose after his first game of wits with Hodges, Brady continued to preoccupy the detective in “Finders Keepers.” And now he may be responsible for more deaths. The first warning comes from Hodges’ ex-partner, Pete Huntley, who calls him to the scene of a murder-suicide that may be his last case before he retires from the force: A mother has killed her quadriplegic daughter, who was among those maimed by Brady Hartsfield, and has then killed herself. But why would she do such a thing? She and her daughter were financially secure, having received a large insurance settlement, and they lived comfortably together. As the evidence mounts, Hodges becomes convinced that Brady is responsible not just for this crime but for a series of apparent suicides. After all, he knows Brady once goaded a woman to kill herself by infecting her computer. Brady may have been written off as profoundly brain damaged at the end of “Mr. Mercedes,” but anything can happen in a Stephen King novel. And, sure enough, it turns out that Brady’s doctor, Felix Babineau, has been giving his patient experimental drugs that are “years away” from human testing, let alone F.D.A. approval. The F.D.A. might want to stick to its guns on this one, because the drugs have caused Brady to develop telekinetic powers — the ability to hypnotize and possess other people against their will. He is thus free to continue his murderous career using their bodies as his puppets: “It’s Al Brooks who wheels the library cart through the hospital’s main lobby . . . and it’s Al who takes another elevator up to the skyway that connects the main hospital to the Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic. It’s Al who says hello to Nurse Rainier at the duty desk, a long-timer who hellos him back without looking up from her computer screen. It’s still Al rolling his cart down the corridor, but when he leaves it in the hall and steps into Room 217, Al Brooks disappears and Z-Boy takes his place.” A Stephen King novel is thrilling to read; he’s never bound by the parameters of one genre. Raymond Chandler is said to have advised detective-story writers, when stuck with a plot, to have a character walk through a door with a gun. But when King gets stuck, his character could walk through a door with a ghost or a box that opens into another dimension or a dog in a top hat who can recite poetry. As is often the case, what is utterly beguiling is King’s slapdash audacity. Three hundred and seventy-two pages into the book, an entirely new character, one of Brady’s long-distance victims, is introduced. Jane Ellsbury is fat. Her whole life story (she got fat) is told in two pages before she kills herself (because she’s so fat) by swallowing a bottle of OxyContin while eating chocolate marshmallow cookies (that’s how she got fat). She even stays in one-note character as she “begins to float away. I’m going on a diet, she thinks. I’m going on a long, long diet. That’s right, the voice . . . tells her. And you’ll never cheat on this one, Jane — will you?” There are times, though, when King’s slapdash audacity can be off-putting. Bill Hodges has two sidekicks in these adventures. Holly Gibney, a middle-aged girl-woman, is also “an organizational genius” and “a computer wizard” who seems to be in a perpetual state of twitching high emotion for no particular reason. Jerome Robinson is an African-American who started out cutting Hodges’ grass and doing odd jobs and is now a Harvard undergraduate. If there were such a thing, Robinson should win the title of White-Gaze Character of the Year. In “Finders Keepers,” he jokingly lapses into a mock field-hand voice, referring to “Massa Hodges” and saying things like “Dis here black boy is one safe drivuh!” He persists in this habit in “End of Watch”: “ ‘You is sem’ny years old, Massa Hodges? Laws! You don’t look a day ovah sixty-fi’!’ ‘Stop it, Jerome,’ Holly says. ‘I know it amuses you but that sort of talk sounds very ignorant and silly.’ ” Elsewhere, a woman sits on Jerome’s lap and says it’s “like getting a date with John Shaft.” At one point, I began to wonder if the mock field-hand voice might have been an ironic attempt by Jerome to broker a discussion about racial power constructs, but then I got distracted by the criminal potential of a computer game called Fishin’ Hole, loaded onto a no-longer-manufactured console called Zappit. In “Finders Keepers,” Hodges, Holly and Jerome are prompted to open an investigation when a little girl thinks something odd is going on with her brother — because he hid a notebook when she came into his room. What does their business strategy look like? In all these books, characters instinctively know things they have no evidence for. Chases start apropos of nothing except feelings or an awareness of “well documented” conditions like personality projection. (“In fact,” Holly tells Hodges, “it’s the second-most-common cause of so-called demonic possession.”) Since King’s world is a gloriously lawless one, there are two or even three possible readings for any part of the story. Here Dr. Babineau is reluctant to let Hodges in to see his patient, Brady Hartsfield. One interpretation might be that hospital staffers know Hodges might be abusive to Brady, but that’s not the way Hodges sees it. He realizes that Dr. Babineau has been possessed by Brady, so he chases the neurosurgeon into the countryside, intent on killing him before Brady can “jump” to someone else. What if Hodges is wrong? Then he’s trying to kill a neuro­surgeon who was just acting to protect a patient. There are many stereotypical themes and devices in crime fiction: righteous cops shooting a criminal at the novel’s end, gender constructs salvaged from another age, invincible heroes and so on. “End of Watch” is burdened by none of them. It’s a great big genre-busting romp, a gloriously fitting end to the Bill Hodges trilogy. Denise Mina’s most recent novel is “Blood, Salt, Water.” ",End of Watch
62,Stephen King,2018-05-22,"By Victor Lavalle THE OUTSIDER By Stephen King 560 pp. Scribner. $30. The first time I wrote a short story I ripped off Stephen King. His first collection, “Night Shift,” came out in 1978. I didn’t read it then; I was only 6. But I picked it up and devoured it at some point, reading and rereading until the cover wore thin and fell off. By the time I’d turned 12 I felt sure I wanted to be a writer — a horror writer — and “Night Shift” became my template. The second story in the collection, “Graveyard Shift,” is about a guy who gets work at a textile mill in a small town in Maine. One night his boss commands a crew of men to help him clean out the basement of the mill, a place that hasn’t been touched in decades. The men descend to discover that rats have turned the basement into their kingdom; the farther they travel into the bowels of this underworld, the bigger and weirder the rats become. Finally, they discover the mother of these mutations, a rat as big as a cow. Things don’t go well. Cupid might as well have hit me with an arrow. I immediately set about plagiarizing the thing. In my version of the tale, called “Rat Patrol,” a group of men work for a vicious boss in a furniture warehouse in Queens. The boss demands these men go into the long unused basement where they discover … cockroaches. The roaches have grown large and predatory and in the deepest corner of the basement they discover, well, you get the idea. At some point my grandmother, cleaning our apartment, threw the story away. I felt furious with her then, but now I see she probably saved me from a lawsuit. Thanks, Jaja! I’ve got a few reasons for sharing this anecdote. The first is the purest: I want to tell you how much of my life has been spent reading Stephen King. The second is to acknowledge the nature of his influence on me. “Graveyard Shift” is a horror story about mutant rats, sure, but it’s also about the power dynamics of the working class; the men in the story can’t say no to their tyrannical boss, not if they want to keep collecting a paycheck. King’s work often underscored such political realities in ways that mattered to me. They reminded me of the struggles of my mother, a secretary working like a dog in New York City. And the last reason for my anecdote is that I want to talk about the difference between inspiration and appropriation. King’s new novel, “The Outsider,” starts out as a crime story. Ralph Anderson, a detective in Flint City, Okla., orders the arrest of a popular local English teacher and Little League coach, Terry Maitland, at a baseball game packed with cheering families. Anderson directs the officers to handcuff Maitland in front, instead of behind his back — and when an officer protests that’s against protocol, Anderson is adamant: “I know, and I don’t care. I want everyone to see him led away in handcuffs. Got it?” Anderson has clear evidence that Maitland raped and mutilated a child. The crime is awful but the proximity — the sense of trust that Maitland enjoyed — is what truly horrifies the detective. So the officers arrest the coach in front of everyone, announcing the charges loudly. As he’s led away, Maitland insists, just as loudly, that he’s innocent. It seems for a while that this will be a story about a crime and its prosecution, but that’s not where this book is headed. I refer back to that story from King’s first collection. A rough but regular day — cleaning out a basement — eventually transforms into a battle with monsters. I don’t want to spoil anything, but come on, this is Stephen King. Monsters of one kind or another are what the man does best, and “The Outsider” delivers a good one. The novel begins in Oklahoma, but eventually winds its way to Marysville, Tex. The trip south allows King to show his hand and reveal exactly whose crate of myths he’s been digging into. King makes generous use of a tale from the region, and the larger cultural context of the place as well. Along with the creature we get riffs on las luchadoras movies from Mexico and a parade called the processo dos Passos that offers vital insight on the Maitland case. The cultures of the Southwest, both Mexico and Texas, play a vital part, but it’s Anderson and a character named Holly Gibney — a private investigator readers may remember from “Mr. Mercedes” — whom King follows most closely. They are, crucially, not Texans. In a nice play on the title, they are outsiders who must ask questions and learn alongside the reader. King doesn’t presume to be an insider, either. There is a cop of Mexican descent, Yune Sablo, and an Anglo woman who grew up in the area, Lovie Ann Bolton, but neither is the protagonist; King doesn’t inhabit them as he does Anderson and Gibney. He doesn’t imply that he knows them with the same authority, yet he writes them as vital members of his cast. This strikes me as a fine definition of the difference between appropriation and inspiration: presumption versus humility. When writers appropriate the stories of others they do something like what I did when I was 12. It was imitation without insight. King falls on the right side of the divide and his book succeeds, in part, because of it. He’s clearly inspired by the Southwest, but he’s not fool enough to pretend ownership. Midway through the novel two characters discuss the films of Stanley Kubrick. One says, “Young artists are much more likely to be risk takers, in my opinion.” It’s played for a laugh — the character prefers “Paths of Glory” to, say, “The Shining” — but it is worth taking the essence of the statement seriously. King is an industry and has been for my entire reading life. He could easily churn out “monsters in Maine” tales until his life ends, and he’d remain well compensated for it. But he doesn’t do that. He isn’t writing mere imitations of himself. More than 50 novels published, and he’s still adding new influences to his work. I can think of a great many literary writers who are far lazier about their range of inspirations and interests. This expansiveness allows King to highlight the idea that whether we’re talking about Mexico or Maine, Oklahoma or Texas, people the world over tell certain stories for reasons that feel much the same: to understand the mysteries of our universe, the improbable and inexplicable. As Holly Gibney muses at one point: “‘Anything is possible,’ she said to the empty room. ‘Anything at all. The world is full of strange nooks and crannies.’” Here’s to mutant rats in the basement and Mexican myths; here’s to the strange and to Stephen King. Still inspiring. Victor LaValle’s most recent novel is “The Changeling.” ",The Outsider
63,Stephen King,2018-10-26,"By Gilbert Cruz ELEVATIONBy Stephen King146 pp. Scribner. $19.95. There’s nothing really light about Stephen King. Not the size of his books (hundreds of pages, often) nor what they are about (death and terror, regularly). But as if provoked by the current state of our politics — which he can’t help tweeting about — King has delivered a near-weightless tale. I read “Elevation” in less time than it took to watch last year’s movie adaptation of “It.” Weight is the preoccupation of this slim novel, which at first feels like a riff on one of King’s earliest works (written under a pseudonym), “Thinner,” about an overweight and callous lawyer who is beset by a curse that has him rapidly dropping pounds. Here, Scott Carey, an average small-town Mainer, is afflicted by a mysterious condition in which he starts to lose weight while outwardly appearing the same. Scott looks 240 pounds. He shows up to his retired doctor’s office wearing a parka, pockets full of quarters and maxes out at 212. Later that night? 210.8 pounds. Two days later? 207.6 pounds. That size-40 waist remains, though. But King also has in mind the weight of close-mindedness and prejudice. A local lesbian couple, Missy and Deirdre, have opened Holy Frijole, a fancy Mexican restaurant. The fact that they are openly married has turned a good part of the town against them and put their restaurant in jeopardy. “The county went for Trump three-to-one in ’16 and they think our stonebrain governor walks on water,” one character says. “If those women had kept it on the down low they would have been fine, but they didn’t. Now there are people who think they’re trying to make some kind of statement.” Intertwining the fantastical and the mundane has long been one of King’s trademarks. Here, Scott just wants to break through Deirdre’s hard exterior and help her save her restaurant. Some of their neighbors are jerks. One of the story’s most gripping moments hinges on the results of a Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot. It’s all pretty small. But in the background the numbers on the scale continue downward. One of King’s other great strengths is the ease with which he can sketch a community or a group of friends. He did it to great effect earlier this year in “The Outsider,” his crime-horror best seller about a small-town Oklahoma Little League coach accused of a grisly murder. And here, Scott, his doctor Bob and the put-upon lesbian couple eventually form a little pod of affection in a town that can wound through tiny cruelties. Speaking of that town, it’s the fictional Castle Rock, setting of several short stories as well as King’s early novels “The Dead Zone,” “Cujo” and “Needful Things.” The latter was subtitled “The Last Castle Rock Story,” though in this time of expanded universes and crossover narratives, why let the dead rest? Last year, King co-wrote a novella set in the town and just this summer, Hulu dropped 10 episodes of its own Castle Rock-set series, giving the King-verse the prestige drama treatment. There’s more than a hint of the “holiday novella” — so popular in the romance genre — to “Elevation,” and I imagine many fans would be satisfied if King settled into a late career of one heavy meal and one amuse bouche every year. While the final pages are reminiscent of one of his son Joe Hill’s best short stories (to mention the title would give away too much), there’s a sweetness that feels like something new for King. It’s heavy out there right now. Here’s something that’s not. Gilbert Cruz is the culture editor at The Times.",Elevation
